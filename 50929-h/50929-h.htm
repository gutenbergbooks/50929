<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>At the time of the death of Mr. Henry Hall,
in 1889, the manuscript for this volume consisted
of finished fragments and many notes.
It was left in the hands of his daughters to
complete. The purpose of the author was to
make a fuller life of Allen than has been written,
and singling him from that cluster of
sturdy patriots in the New Hampshire Grants,
to make plain the vivid personality of a Vermont
hero to the younger generations. Mr.
Hall's well-known habit of accuracy and painstaking
investigation must be the guaranty that
this "Life" is worthy of a place among the volumes
of the history of our nation.</p>

<p class="pfs70">AN ACCOUNT OF HIS FAMILY.</p>


<p>Ethan Allen is the Robin Hood of Vermont.
As Robin Hood's life was an Anglo-Saxon
protest against Norman despotism, so
Allen's life was a protest against domestic robbery
and foreign tyranny. As Sherwood Forest
was the rendezvous of the gallant and
chivalrous Robin Hood, so the Green Mountains
were the home of the dauntless and high-minded
Ethan Allen. As Robin Hood, in
Scott's "Ivanhoe," so does Allen, in Thompson's
"Green Mountain Boys," win our
admiration. Although never a citizen of the
United States, he is one of the heroes of the
state and the nation; one of those whose
names the people will not willingly let die.
History and tradition, song and story, sculpt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>ure,
engraving, and photography alike blazon
his memory from ocean to ocean. The librarian
of the great library at Worcester, Massachusetts,
told Colonel Higginson that the
book most read was Daniel P. Thompson's
"Green Mountain Boys." Already one centennial
celebration of the capture of Ticonderoga
has been celebrated. Who can tell how
many future anniversaries of that capture our
nation will live to see! Another reason for refreshing
our memories with the history of Allen
is the bitterness with which he is attacked.
He has been accused of ignorance, weakness
of mind, cowardice, infidelity, and atheism.
Among his assailants have been the president
of a college, a clergyman, editors, contributors
to magazines and newspapers, and
even a local historian among a variety of
writers of greater or less prominence. If
Vermont is careful of her own fame, well
does it become the people to know whether
Ethan Allen was a hero or a humbug.</p>

<p>Arnold calls history the vast Mississippi of
falsehood. The untruths that have been
published about Allen during the last hundred
and fifteen years might not fill and overflow
the Ohio branch of such a Mississippi, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
they would make a lively rivulet run until it
was dammed by its own silt. The late Benjamin
Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, fought a
duel with Daniel O'Connell, because O'Connell
declared it to be his belief that Disraeli was
a lineal descendant of the impenitent thief on
the Cross. Perhaps the libellers of Allen are
descended from the Yorkers whom he stamped
so ignominiously with the beech seal. The
fierce light of publicity perhaps never beat
upon a throne more sharply than for more than
a hundred years it has beat upon Ethan Allen.
His patriotism, courage, religious belief, and
general character have been travestied and
caricatured until now the real man has to be
dug up from heaps of untruthful rubbish, as
the peerless Apollo Belvidere was dug in the
days of Columbus from the ruins of classic
Antium.</p>

<p>Discrepancies exist even in regard to his
age. On the stone tablet over his grave his
age is given as fifty years. Thompson said his
age was fifty-two. At the unveiling of his
statue, he was called thirty-eight years old
when Ticonderoga was taken. These three
statements are erroneous, and, strange to say,
Burlington is responsible for them all, Bur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>lington,
the Athens of Vermont, the town
wherein rest his ashes, the town wherein most
of the last two years of his life were passed,
and the town that has done most to honor his
memory.</p>

<p>However humiliating it may be to state
pride, it is probable that the Allens, centuries
ago, were no more respectable than the ancestors
of Queen Victoria and the oldest British
peers. The different ways of spelling the
name, Alleyn, Alain, Allein, and Allen, seem
to indicate a Norman origin. George Allen,
professor in the University of Pennsylvania,
says that Alain had command of the rear of
William the Conqueror's army at the battle of
Hastings in 1066.</p>

<p>Joseph Allen, the father of Ethan, comes to
the surface of history about the year 1720, one
year after the death of Addison and the first
publication of "Robinson Crusoe," in the town
of Coventry, in Eastern Connecticut, twenty
miles east of Hartford. When he first appears
to us he is a minor and an orphan. His
widowed mother, Mercy, has several children,
one of them of age. Their first recorded act
is emigration fifty miles westward to Litchfield,
famous for its scenery and ancient elms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
located between the Naugatuck and the Shepaug
rivers, on the Green and Taconic mountain
ranges; famous also as the place where
the first American ladies' seminary was located,
and most famous of all for its renowned
law-school, begun over a century ago by
Judge Tapping Reeve and continued by Judge
James Gould. Chief Justice John Pierpoint and
United States Senator S. S. Phelps were among
its notable pupils. The widow, Mercy Allen,
died in Litchfield, February 5, 1728. Her son
Joseph bought one-third of her real estate.
Within five years he sold two tracts, of 100
acres each, and fourteen years after his mother's
death he sold the residue as wild land.
On March 11, 1737, Joseph Allen was married
to Mary Baker, daughter of John Baker, of
Woodbury, sister of Remember Baker, who
was father of the Remember Baker that came
to Vermont. Thus Ethan Allen and Remember
Baker were cousins.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen was born January 10, 1737,
and died February 21, 1789, and consequently
he has been said to have been fifty-two years,
one month and two days old. In fact, he was
fifty-one years, one month and two days old.
The year 1737 terminated March 24. Had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
closed December 31, Allen would have been
born in 1738. The first day of the year was
March 25 until 1752 in England and her colonies.
In 1751 the British Parliament changed
New Year's Day from March 25 to January 1.
The year 1751 had no January, no February,
and only seven days of March. Allen was
thirteen years old in 1750, and was fourteen
years old in 1752.</p>

<p>The year 1738 gave birth to three honest
men&mdash;Ethan Allen, George III., and Benjamin
West. In 1738 George Washington was six
years old, John Adams three years old, John
Stark ten years old, Israel Putnam twenty
years old. Seth Warner and Jefferson were
born five years later. In that year no claim
had ever been made to Vermont by New York
or New Hampshire. No one had ever questioned
the right of Massachusetts to the English
part of Vermont. New Hampshire was
bounded on the west by the Merrimac. Colden,
the surveyor-general of New York, in
an official report bounded New York on the
east by Connecticut and Massachusetts, on
the north by Lake Ontario and Canada;
Canada occupying Crown Point and Chimney
Point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>If by waving a magician's wand the English-American
colonies on the Atlantic slope,
as they existed in 1738, could pass before us,
wherein would the tableau differ from that of
to-day? West of the Alleghanies there were
the Indians and the French. On the north
were 50,000 prosperous French, farmers chiefly
along the valley of the St. Lawrence from
Montreal to Quebec. On the east, Acadie, including
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and a
part of Maine, was Scotch. Florida was
Spanish. From Georgia to Maine were 1,500,000
English-Americans and 400,000 African-Americans.
The colony of New York had a
population of 60,100. New Hampshire, consisting
of a few thousand settlers, was located
north and east of the Merrimac, and had a legislature
of its own, but no governor. Massachusetts,
with its charters from James I. and
Charles I., claimed the country to the Pacific
Ocean, and exercised ownership between the
Merrimac and Connecticut and west of the Connecticut,
without a breath of opposition from
any mortal. Massachusetts had sold land as
her own which she found to be in Connecticut,
and she paid that state for it by granting her
many thousand acres in three of the southeast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ern
townships of Vermont. She built and sustained
a fort in Brattleboro', kept a garrison
there with a salaried chaplain, salaried resident
Indian commissioner, and she established a
store supplied with provisions, groceries, and
goods suitable for trade with frontiersmen and
the Indians of Canada. Bartering was actively
carried on along the Connecticut River, Black
River, Otter Creek, and Lake Champlain. In
1737 a solemn ratification of the old treaty occurred
there; speeches were made, presents
given, and the healths of George II. and Governor
Belcher, of Massachusetts, were duly drunk.
There was no Anglo-Saxon settlement in Vermont
outside of Brattleboro'. In Pownal were
a few families of Dutch squatters. The Indian
village of St. Francis, midway between Montreal
and Quebec, peopled partly by New England
refugees from King Philip's war of 1676,
exercised supreme control over northeastern
Vermont.</p>

<p>In all the land were only three colleges:
Harvard, one hundred and two years old,
Yale, thirty-seven, and William and Mary,
forty-five.</p>

<p>Ethan Allen had five brothers, Heman,
Heber, Levi, Zimri, and Ira, and two sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Lydia and Lucy. Of all our early heroes, few
glide before us with a statelier step or more
beneficent mien than Heman Allen, the oldest
brother of Ethan. Born in Cornwall, Connecticut,
October 15, 1740, dying in Salisbury,
Connecticut, May 18, 1778, his life of thirty-seven
and a half years was like that of the
Chevalier Bayard, without fear and without
reproach. A man of affairs, a merchant and
a soldier, a politician and a land-owner, a
diplomat and a statesman, he was capable, intelligent,
honest, earnest, and true. But fifteen
years old when his father died, he was early engaged
in trade at Salisbury. His home became
the home of his widowed mother and her large
family. Salisbury was his home and probably
his legal residence, although he represented
Rutland and Colchester in the Vermont Conventions,
and was sent to Congress by Dorset.</p>

<p>Heber was the first town clerk of Poultney.</p>

<p>Ira was able, shrewd, and gentlemanly; a
land surveyor and speculator, a lieutenant in
Warner's regiment, a member of all the conventions
of 1776 and 1777, of the Councils of
Safety and of the State Council; state treasurer,
surveyor-general, author of a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'History of 'Vermont,">"History
of Vermont",</ins> and of various official papers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
political pamphlets. In 1796 he bought, in
France, twenty-four brass cannon and twenty
thousand muskets, ostensibly for the Vermont
militia, which were seized by the English.
After a lawsuit of seven or eight years he regained
them, but the expense beggared him.
He died in Philadelphia, January 7, 1814, aged
sixty-three years.</p>

<p>Levi Allen joined in the expedition to capture
Ticonderoga, became Tory, and was complained
of by his brother Ethan as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Bennington County</span>, <em>ss.</em>:</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Arlington</span>, 9 January, 1779.</p>

<p>To the Hon. the Court of Confiscation, comes
Col. Ethan Allen, in the name of the freemen
of the state, and complaint makes that Levi
Allen, late of Salisbury in Connecticut, is of Tory
principles and holds in fee sundry tracts and parcels
of land in this State. The said Levi, has
been detected in endeavoring to supply the enemy
on Long Island; and in attempting to circulate
counterfeit continental money, and is guilty of
holding treasonable correspondence with the enemy
under cover of doing favors to me when a
prisoner at New York and Long Island; and in
talking and using influence in favor of the enemy,
associating with inimical persons to this country,
and with them monopolizing the necessaries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
life; in endeavoring to lessen the credit of the
continental currency, and in particular hath exerted
himself in the most fallacious manner to injure
the property and character of some of the
most zealous friends to the independence of the
U. S. and of this State likewise: all which inimical
conduct is against the peace and dignity of the
freemen of this State. I therefore pray the Hon.
Court to take the matter under their consideration
and make confiscation of the estate of said Levi
before mentioned, according to the laws and customs
of this State, in such case made and provided.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Ethan Allen.</p></div>

<p>Levi died while in jail, for debt, at Burlington,
Vermont, in 1801.</p>

<p>Zimri lived and died in Sheffield.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="pfs70">EARLY LIFE, HABITS OF THOUGHT, AND RELIGIOUS
TENDENCIES.</p>


<p>The life of Allen may be divided into four
periods: the first thirty-one years before he
came to Vermont (1738-1769), the six years in
Vermont before his captivity (1769-1775), the
two years and eight months of captivity (1775-1778),
and the eleven years in Vermont after
his captivity (1778-1789).</p>

<p>When he was two years old the family moved
into Cornwall. There his brothers and sisters
were born, there his father died, there Ethan
lived until he was twenty-four years old.
When seventeen he was fitting for college with
the Rev. Mr. Lee, of Salisbury. His father's
death put an end to his studies. This was in
1755, when the French and Indian war was
raging along Lakes George and Champlain,
a war which lasted until Allen's twenty-third
year. Some of the early settlers of Vermont,
Samuel Robinson, Joseph Bowker, and others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
took part in this war. Not so Allen. There
is no intimation that he hungered for a
soldier's life in his youth. His usual means
of earning a livelihood for himself and his
widowed mother's family is supposed to have
been agriculture.</p>

<p>William Cothrens, in his "History of Ancient
Woodbury," tells us that in January, 1762,
Allen, with three others, entered into the iron
business in Salisbury, Connecticut, and built
a furnace. In June of that year he returned
to Roxbury, and married Mary Brownson, a
maiden five years older than himself. The
marriage fee was four shillings, or sixty-seven
cents. By this wife he had five children:
one son, who died at the age of eleven, while
Ethan was a captive, and four daughters.
Two died unmarried; one married Eleazer W.
Keyes, of Burlington; the other married the
Hon. Samuel Hitchcock, of Burlington, and
was the mother of General Ethan Allen
Hitchcock, U. S. A.</p>

<p>Allen resided with his family first at Salisbury
and afterward at Sheffield, the southwest
corner town of Massachusetts. For six miles
the boundary line of the two states is the
boundary line of the two towns. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
towns the families of Ethan Allen and his
brothers and sisters lived many years. Two
years after moving to Salisbury he bought
two and a half acres, or one-sixteenth part
of a tract of land on Mine Hill, an elevation
of 350 feet in Roxbury, containing, it is
said, the most remarkable deposit of spathic
iron ore in the United States. Immense sums
of money were expended in vain attempts to
work it as a silver mine. Two years after
Allen began his Vermont life he still owned
land in Judea Society, a part of the present
town of Washington. The details and financial
results of these business undertakings are
not furnished us. They indicate enterprise, if
nothing more. Carrying on a farm, casting
iron ware, and working a mine, not military
affairs, seem to have been the avenues wherein
Allen developed his executive ability during
his early manhood.</p>

<p>What were his educational facilities, his social
privileges, and his religious views during
this formative period of his life? Ira Allen,
in 1795, writes to Dr. S. Williams, the early
historian of Vermont, that when his father,
Joseph Allen, died, his brother Ethan was preparing
for college, and that the death of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
father obliged Ethan to discontinue his classical
studies. Mr. Jehial Johns, of Huntington,
told the Rev. Zadock Thompson that he
knew Ethan Allen in Connecticut, and was
very certain that Allen spent some time studying
with the Rev. Mr. Lee, of Salisbury, with
the view of fitting himself for college. The
widow of Judge Samuel Hitchcock, of Burlington,
told Mr. Thompson that Ethan's attendance
at school did not exceed three months.
Ira Allen writes General Haldimand in July,
1781, that his brother Ethan has resigned his
Brigadier-Generalship in the Vermont militia,
and "returned to his old studies, philosophy."
To what period in Ethan's life does the phrase
"old studies" refer? It could not be his life
after the captivity, during his five years' collisions
with the Yorkers, but the period we
are now considering. Heman Allen's widow,
when Mrs. Wadhams, told Zadock Thompson
that one summer when he was residing in her
house he passed almost all the time in writing.
She did not know what was the subject of his
study, but on one occasion she called him to
dinner, and he said he was very sorry she had
called him so soon, for he had "got clear up
into the upper regions." Allen himself says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In my youth I was much disposed to contemplation,
and at my commencement in manhood I committed
to manuscript such sentiments or arguments
as appeared most consonant to reason, lest through
the debility of memory, my improvement should
have been less gradual. This method of scribbling
I practised for many years, from which I
experienced great advantages in the progression
of learning and knowledge; the more so as I was
deficient in education and had to acquire the
knowledge of grammar and language, as well as
the art of reasoning, principally from a studious
application to it; which after all, I am sensible,
lays me under disadvantages, particularly in matters
of composition; however, to remedy this defect
I have substituted the most unwearied pains....
Ever since I arrived at the state of manhood
and acquainted myself with the general
history of mankind, I have felt a sincere passion
for liberty. The history of nations doomed to
perpetual slavery in consequence of yielding up to
tyrants their natural-born liberties, I read with a
sort of philosophical horror.</p></div>

<p>In Allen's youth great revivals were inaugurated,
organized, and continued mainly
by the preaching of Whitefield, who roused
and electrified audiences of several thousands,
as men have rarely been moved since the days
of Peter the Hermit. Even Franklin, Bolingbroke,
and Chesterfield were fascinated by him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
As for Allen, baptized in his infancy, in the
days when no Sabbath-school blessed the race,
when the Westminster Catechism and Watts'
Hymns were in use throughout New England
(Isaac Watts died when Allen was eleven years
old), living in and near northwest Connecticut
in as democratic and religious community as the
world had ever seen, reading none of the books
of the Deists, he was fond of discussion and
delighted in writing out his arguments. Having
been brought up an Armenian Christian, in
contradistinction to a Calvinistic Christian, his
views in early manhood began to change. One
picture of this gradual evolution he gives us
in the following description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The doctrine of imputation according to the
Christian scheme consists of two parts. First, of
imputation of the apostasy of Adam and Eve to
their posterity, commonly called original sin;
and secondly, of the imputation of the merits or
righteousness of Christ, who in Scripture is called
the second Adam to mankind or to the elect. This
is a concise definition of the doctrine, and which
will undoubtedly be admitted to be a just one by
every denomination of men who are acquainted
with Christianity, whether they adhere to it or not.</p>

<p>I therefore proceed to illustrate and explain the
doctrine by transcribing a short but very perti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>nent
conversation which in the early days of my
manhood I had with a Calvinistic divine; but
previously remark that I was educated in what
are commonly called the Armenian principles;
and among other tenets to reject the doctrine of
original sin; this was the point at issue between
the clergyman and me. In my turn I opposed
the doctrine of original sin with philosophical
reasonings, and as I thought had confuted the
doctrine. The Reverend gentleman heard me
through patiently: and with candor replied:</p>

<p>"Your metaphysical reasonings are not to the
purpose, inasmuch as you are a Christian and hope
and expect to be saved by the imputed righteousness
of Christ to you; for you may as well be imputedly
sinful as imputedly righteous. Nay," said
he, "if you hold to the doctrine of satisfaction and
atonement by Christ, by so doing you presuppose
the doctrine of apostasy or original sin to be in
fact true;" for, said he, "if mankind were not in a
ruined and condemned state by nature, there could
have been no need of a Redeemer; but each individual
of them would have been accountable to his
Creator and Judge, upon the basis of his own
moral agency. Further observing that upon philosophical
principles it was difficult to account for
the doctrine of original sin, or of original righteousness;
yet as they were plain, fundamental doctrines
of the Christian faith we ought to assent to
the truth of them; and that from the divine authority
of revelation. Notwithstanding," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"if you will give me a philosophical explanation
of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'origial'">original</ins> imputed righteousness, which you profess
to believe and expect salvation by, then I will
return you a philosophical explanation of original
sin; for it is plain," said he, "that your objections
lie with equal weight against original imputed
righteousness, as against original imputed sin."</p>

<p>Upon which I had the candor to acknowledge
to the worthy ecclesiastic, that upon the Christian
plan I perceived the argument had clearly terminated
against me. For at that time I dared not
to distrust the infallibility of revelation; much
more to dispute it. However, this conversation
was uppermost in my mind for several months
after; and after many painful searches and researches
after the truth, respecting the doctrine
of imputation, resolved at all events to abide the
decision of rational argument in the premises;
and on a full examination of both parts of the
doctrine, rejected the whole; for on a fair scrutiny,
I found that I must concede to it entirely or
not at all; or else believe inconsistently as the
clergyman had argued.</p></div>

<p>He relates also a change from his juvenile
views of biblical history:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When I was a boy, by one means or other, I had
conceived a very bad opinion of Pharaoh; he
seemed to me to be a cruel, despotic prince; he
would not give the Israelites straw, but nevertheless,
demanded of them the full tale of brick; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a time he opposed God Almighty; but was at last
luckily drowned in the Red Sea; at which event,
with other good Christians, I rejoiced, and even
exulted at the overthrow of the base and wicked
tyrant. But after a few years of maturity and examination
of the history of that monarch given
by Moses, with the before recited remarks of the
apostle, I conceived a more favorable opinion of
him; inasmuch as we are told that God raised
him up and hardened his heart, and predestinated
his reign, his wickedness, and his overthrow.</p></div>

<p>In 1782 he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the circle of my acquaintance (which has not
been small), I have generally been denominated a
Deist, the reality of which I never disputed; being
conscious I am no Christian, except mere
infant baptism makes me one; and as to being a
Deist, I know not, strictly speaking, whether I am
one or not, for I have never read their writings.</p></div>

<p>We are told that Allen in his early life was
very intimate with Dr. Thomas Young, the
man who supplied the state with its name,
"Vermont," in April, 1777, and who so strongly
encouraged it to assert its independence. One
of the most noted characteristics of Ethan, his
fondness for the society of able men, is illustrated
in his association with Young.</p>

<p>Dr. Young, who was a distinguished citizen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Philadelphia, was on most of the Whig committees
in Boston, before the Revolution, with
James Otis, Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren,
and others. He and Adams addressed the
great public meeting on the day "when Boston
harbor was black with unexpected tea." He
was a neighbor of Allen, living in the Oblong,
in Dutchess County, while Allen lived in Salisbury.
Afterward he lived in Albany, and died
in Philadelphia in the third year of Allen's
captivity. He was influential in causing Vermont
to adopt the constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Oblong, Salisbury and vicinity, abounded
in free thinkers. Young and Allen opposed
President Edwards' famous theological tenets,
the latter spending much time in Young's
house, and it was generally understood that they
were preparing for publication a book in support
of sceptical principles; the two agreeing that
the one that outlived the other should publish
it. Allen, on going to Vermont, left his manuscripts
with Young, and on his release from
captivity after Young's death obtained from
the latter's family, who had gone back to
Dutchess County, both his own and Young's
manuscripts, and these were the originals of
his "Oracles of Reason."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="pfs70">REMOVAL TO VERMONT.&mdash;THE NEW HAMPSHIRE
GRANTS.</p>


<p>Allen came to Vermont, probably, in 1769,
a year memorable for the founding of Dartmouth
College and for the birth of four of
earth's renowned men: two soldiers, Wellington
and Napoleon; two scholars, Cuvier and
Humboldt.</p>

<p>In the early history of Vermont, one of its
prominent judges speculated extensively in
Green Mountain wild lands. The aggregate
result of these speculations was disastrous.
Attending a session of the legislature, the
judge was called upon by a committee for his
advice in reference to suitable penalties for
some crime. He replied, advising for the first
offence a fine; for the second, imprisonment;
and if the criminal should prove such a hardened
offender, such a veteran in vice as to be
guilty the third time, he recommended that
the scoundrel should be compelled to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a deed of a mile square of wild Vermont lands.
Speculation in wild lands is a feature of pioneer
society. Vermont was once the agricultural
Eldorado of New England. Emigration first
rolled northward. Since that time a certain
star, erroneously supposed to belong to Bishop
Berkeley, has been travelling westward.</p>

<p>In 1749 Benning Wentworth, Governor of
New Hampshire, issued a patent of a township,
six miles square, near the northwest angle of
Massachusetts and corresponding with its line
northward, and in this township of Bennington
the Allens bought lands and made their
home. This grant caused a remonstrance from
the governor and council of New York. Similar
remonstrances had been made in the cases
of Connecticut and Massachusetts, each of
whom claimed that their territory extended
to the Connecticut River. But that question
had been settled in the former cases between
New York and New England by agreeing upon
a line from the southwest corner of Connecticut
northerly to Lake Champlain as the boundary
between the provinces. Wentworth urged in
justification of his course that the boundary line
was well known, and that New Hampshire had
the same right as the other colonies of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
England, and he persevered in his own course.
In 1754 fourteen new townships had been
granted, when the French war broke out and
the settlers were deterred from occupying
their lands by the incursions of the French
and Indians on the frontier and the uncertainty
of the termination of the contest; but
when Canada was reduced by the English and
peace concluded, there was a new rush for the
possession of the fertile lands by the hardy
and adventurous sons of the old New England
colonies. In four years Governor Wentworth
granted one hundred and thirty-eight
townships, and the territory included was
called the New Hampshire Grants. Then
began in bitter earnest the long controversy
between New York and New Hampshire for
the ownership of all the territory now known
as Vermont.</p>

<p>In order to make clear the circumstances of
the time when Ethan Allen came to the front,
it is necessary to explain something of the
origin of the strife. The New York claim was
founded on a charter given by Charles II. to
his brother, the Duke of York, in 1664, for
the country lying between the Connecticut and
Delaware rivers. But that charter had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
been considered as practically a nullity, for
when the Duke of York succeeded to the
throne of England, it all became public property
subject to the king's divisions; and
there are strong reasons for believing that the
mention of the Connecticut was merely a
formality, not intended as a definite boundary,
and that the design was to take in the whole
of the New Netherlands. The geography of
the country was little known, and the wording
of the charter was ambiguous and vague.
Allen at once espoused the cause of the settlers.
But for him the State of Vermont would
probably have never existed. But for Allen,
Albany, not Montpelier, might have been the
capital of Vermont. Allen's most illustrious
achievement for the benefit of the nation was
the capture of Ticonderoga. His great work
for Vermont was successful resistance to the
Yorkers.</p>

<p>Before entering upon this period of litigation,
one of the stories of Allen, illustrating
his honesty, may fitly find a place. Having
given a note which he was unable to pay
when it became due, he was sued. Allen employed
a lawyer to attend to his case and postpone
payment. But the lawyer could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
prevent the rendering a judgment against
Allen at the first term of court, unless he filed
a plea alleging some real or fictitious ground
of defence. Accordingly, quite innocently he
put in the usual plea denying that Allen signed
the note. The effect of this was to continue
the case to the next term of court, exactly
what Allen wanted; but Allen was present and
was indignant that he should be made to appear
to sanction a falsehood. He rose in
court and vehemently denounced his lawyer,
telling him that he did not employ him to tell
a lie; he did sign that note; he wanted to pay
it; he only wanted time!</p>

<p>It was in June, 1770, that Allen first became
prominent in Vermont public affairs.
Then it was that the lawsuits brought by
Yorkers for Vermont lands were tried before
the Supreme Court at Albany. Robert R.
Livingston was the presiding judge; Kempe
and Duane, attorneys for plaintiffs; Silvester,
of Albany, and Jared Ingersoll, of New
Haven, attorneys for defendants. Ethan
Allen was active in preparing the defence.
But of what avail was defence when the court
was virtually an adverse party to the suit?
Not only did Duane claim 50,000 acres of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Vermont lands, but, to the disgrace of English
jurisprudence, Livingston, the presiding
judge, was interested directly or indirectly in
30,000 acres. The farce was soon played out;
the court refused to hear the New Hampshire
charter read; one trial was sufficient; the
plaintiffs won all the cases. Duane and others
called on Allen and reminded him that "might
makes right," advising him to go home and
counsel compromise. Allen observed: "The
gods of the valleys are not the gods of the
hills!" Duane asked for an explanation, and
Allen replied: "If you will come to Bennington
the meaning shall be made clear to
you."</p>

<p>Allen went home and no compromise was
thought of. The great seal of New Hampshire
being disregarded, the "Beech Seal" was
invented as a substitute. A military organization
was formed with several companies,
Seth Warner, Remember Baker, and others as
captains, and Ethan Allen as colonel.</p>

<p>In July, 1771, on the farm of James Breakenridge,
in Bennington, the State of Vermont was
born. Ten Eyck, the sheriff, with 300 men, including
mayor, aldermen, lawyers, and others,
issued forth from Albany, as did De Soto to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
capture Florida, as Don Quixote essayed to
conquer the windmills. Breakenridge's family
were wisely absent. In his house were eighteen
armed men provided with a red flag to run up
the chimney as a signal for aid. The house
was barricaded and provided with loop-holes.
On the woody ridge north were 100 armed
men, their heads and the muzzles of their
guns barely visible amid the foliage. To the
southeast, in plain sight, was a smaller body
of men within gunshot of the house. Six
or seven guarded the bridge half a mile to the
west. Mayor Cuyler and a few others were allowed
to cross the bridge and a parley ensued.
The mayor returned to the bridge, and in half
an hour the sheriff was notified that possession
would be kept at all hazards. He ordered
the posse to advance, and a small portion reluctantly
complied. Another parley followed,
while lawyer Yates expounded New York law
and the Vermonters justified their position.
The sheriff seized an axe, and going toward
the door, threatened to break it open. In an instant
an array of guns was aimed at him; he
stopped, retired to the bridge, and ordered the
posse to advance five miles into Bennington.
But the Yorkers stampeded for home, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bubble burst. The "star that never sets" had
begun to glimmer upon the horizon.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1771-72 Governor Tryon, of
New York, issued proclamations heavy with
ponderous logic and shotted with offers of
money for the arrest of Allen and others. To
the arguments Allen replied through a newspaper,
the Connecticut <cite>Courant</cite>, of Hartford.
To the premium for his arrest he returned a
Roland for an Oliver in the following placard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>£25 Reward.&mdash;Whereas James Duane and John
Kempe, of New York, have by their menaces and
threats greatly disturbed the public peace and repose
of the honest peasants of Bennington and the
settlements to the northward, which are now and
ever have been in the peace of God and the King,
and are patriotic and liege subjects of Geo. the 3d.
Any person that will apprehend those common disturbers,
viz: James Duane and John Kempe, and
bring them to Landlord Fay's, at Bennington,
shall have £15 reward for James Duane and £10
reward for John Kempe, paid by</p>

<p class="noindent pad16">
<span class="smcap">Ethan Allen.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Remember Baker.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Robert Cochran.</span></p>

<p class="noindent mmx3">Dated Poultney,</p>
<p>Feb. 5, 1772.</p>
</div>

<p>Duane and Kempe were prominent lawyers
of New York, and also prominent as advocates
of New York's claim to Vermont lands. Duane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was the son-in-law of Robert Livingston and
Kempe was attorney-general. The idea of
their being kidnapped for exhibition at a log
tavern in the wilderness was slightly grotesque.
But this did not satisfy Allen. He would fain
visit the enemy in one of his strongholds.</p>

<p>Albany was emphatically a Dutch city, for
it was two centuries old before it had 10,000
inhabitants. In 1772 it might have had half
that number. While the country was flooded
with proclamations for his arrest, Allen rode
alone into the city. Slowly passing through
the streets to the principal hotel he dismounted,
entered the bar-room, and called for a bowl
of punch. The news circulated; the Dutch
rallied; the crowd centred at the hotel; the
officers of the court, the valiant sheriff, Ten
Eyck, and the attorney-general were present.
Allen raised the punch-bowl, bowed courteously
to the crowd, swallowed the beverage, returned
to the street, remounted his horse, rose in his
stirrups and shouted "Hurrah for the Green
Mountains!" and then leisurely rode away unharmed
and unmolested. The incident illustrates
Allen's shrewd courage, and sustains
Governor Hall's theory that the people of New
York sympathized more with the Green Moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>tain
Boys than with their own land-gambling
officers.</p>

<p>At the Green Mountain tavern in Bennington
was a sign-post, with a sign twenty-five
feet from the ground. Over the sign was the
stuffed skin of a catamount with large teeth
grinning toward New York. A Dutchman of
Arlington who had been active against the
Green Mountain Boys was punished by being
tied in an arm-chair, hoisted to this sign, and
there suspended for two hours, to the amusement
of the juvenile population and the quiet
gratification of their seniors.</p>

<p class="pfs70">ALLEN AND THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS.&mdash;NEGOTIATIONS
BETWEEN THE NEW YORK AND THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE GRANTS.</p>


<p>During the six years preceding the Revolution,
Allen was the most prominent leader of
the Green Mountain Boys in all matters of
peace, and also in political writing. When
the Manchester Convention, October 21, 1772,
sent James Breakenridge, of Bennington, and
Jehiel Hawley, of Arlington, as delegates to
England, perhaps Allen could not be spared,
for if any New York document needed answering
Allen answered it; if any handbill, proclamation
or counter-statement, or political or
legal argument was to be written, Allen wrote
it; if New England was to be informed of the
Yorkers' rascalities, Allen sent the information
to the Connecticut <cite>Courant</cite> and Portsmouth
<cite>Gazette</cite>, Vermont having no newspaper. Rarely
was force or threat used or a rough joke
played on a Yorker, but Allen was first in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fray. In Bennington County Allen with others
told a Yorker that they had "that morning
resolved to offer a burnt sacrifice to the gods
of the woods in burning the logs of his house."
They did burn the logs and the rafters, and
told him to go and complain to his "scoundrel
governor."</p>

<p>Of all the towns of Western Vermont,
Clarendon had been most noted for its Tories
and its Yorkers. Settled as early as 1768, its
settlers founded their claims to land titles on
grants from three different powers: Colonel
Lydius, New York, and New Hampshire. The
New York patent of Socialborough, covering
Rutland and Pittsford substantially, was dated
April 3, 1771, and issued by Governor Dunmore.
The New York patent of Durham, dated January
7, 1772, issued by Governor Tryon, covered
Clarendon. Both were in direct violation
of the royal order in council, July, 1767, and
therefore illegal and void. The new county
of Charlotte, created March 12, 1772, extended
from Canada into Arlington and Sunderland
and west of Lake George and Lake Champlain.
Benjamin Spencer, of Durham, was a justice
and judge of the new county; Jacob Marsh, of
Socialborough, a justice; and Simeon Jenny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
who lived near Chippenhook, coroner. These
three officers were zealous New York partisans.
The Green Mountain Boys in council passed
resolutions to the effect that no citizen should
do any official act under New York authority;
that all persons holding Vermont lands should
hold them under New Hampshire laws, and
if necessary force should be used to enforce
these resolves.</p>

<p>In the early part of the fall of 1773, a large
force of Green Mountain Boys, under Ethan
Allen and other leaders, visited Clarendon and
requested the Yorkers to comply with these
resolutions, informing them if this were not
done within a reasonable time the persons of
the Durhamites would suffer. Justice Spencer
absconded. No violence was used except on
one poor innocent dog of the name of Tryon,
and Governor Tryon was so odious that the dog
was cut in pieces without benefit of clergy.
This display of force and the threats that were
very freely used, it was hoped, would be
enough to secure submission, but the justices
still issued writs against the New Hampshire
settlers; other New York officials acted, and
all were loud in advocating the New York
title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>A second visit to Durham was made. Saturday,
November 20, at 11 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, Ethan Allen,
Remember Baker, and twenty to thirty others
surrounded Spencer's house, took him prisoner,
and carried him two miles to the house of one
Green, where he was kept under a guard of
four men until Monday morning, and then
taken "to the house of Joseph Smith, of Durham,
innkeeper." He was asked where he
preferred to be tried; he replied that he was
not guilty of any crime, but if he must be
tried, he should choose his own door as the
place of trial. The Green Mountain Boys had
now increased in number to about one hundred
and thirty, armed with guns, cutlasses, and other
weapons. The people of Clarendon, Rutland,
and Pittsford hearing of the trial, gathered to
witness the proceedings. A rural lawsuit still
has a wonderful fascination for a rural populace.
Allen addressed the crowd, telling them that
he, with Remember Baker, Seth Warner, and
Robert Cochran, had been appointed to inspect
and set things in order; that "Durham had
become a hornets' nest" which must be broken
up. A "judgment seat" was erected; Allen,
Warner, Baker, and Cochran took seats thereon
as judges, and Spencer was ordered to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
before this tribunal, take off his hat, and listen
to the accusations. Allen accused him of joining
with New York land jobbers against New
Hampshire grantees and issuing a warrant as
a justice. Warner accused him of accepting a
New York commission as a magistrate, of acting
under it, of writing a letter hostile to
New Hampshire, of selling land bought of a
New York grantee, and of trying to induce
people to submit to New York. He was found
guilty, his house declared a nuisance, and the
sentence was pronounced that his house be
burnt, and that he promise not to act again as a
New York justice. Spencer declared that if his
house were burned, his store of dry-goods and
all his property would be destroyed and his wife
and children would be great sufferers. Thereupon
the sentence was reconsidered. Warner
suggested that his house be not destroyed, but
that the roof be taken off and put on again,
provided Spencer should acknowledge that it
was put on under a New Hampshire title and
should purchase a New Hampshire title. The
judges so decided. Spencer promised compliance,
and "with great shouting" the roof was
taken off and replaced, and this pioneer dry-goods
store of 1773 was preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time twenty or thirty of Allen's
party visit the house of Coroner Jenny. The
house was deserted; Jenny had fled, and they
burned the house to the ground. The other
Durhamites were visited and threatened, and
they agreed to purchase New Hampshire titles.
Some of the party returning from Clarendon
met Jacob Marsh in Arlington, on his way from
New York to Rutland. They seized him and
put him on trial. Warner and Baker were the
accusers. Baker wished to apply the "beech
seal," but the judges declined. Warner read
the sentence that he should encourage New
Hampshire settlers, discourage New York
settlers, and not act as a New York justice,
"upon pain of having his house burnt and reduced
to ashes and his person punished at
their pleasure." He was then dismissed with
the following certificate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Arlington, Nov. 25, <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 1773. These may
sertify that Jacob Marsh haith been examined, and
had a fare trial, so that our mob shall not meadel
farther with him as long as he behaves.</p>

<p>Sertified by us as his judges, to wit,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching home, Marsh found that the
roof of his house had been publicly taken off
by the Green Mountain Boys.</p>

<p>Spencer in his letter to Duane, April 11,
1772, wrote: "One Ethan Allen hath brought
from Connecticut twelve or fifteen of the most
blackguard fellows he can get, double-armed,
in order to protect him." This same Spencer,
after acting as a Whig and one of the Council
of Safety, deserted to Burgoyne in 1777, and
died a few weeks after at Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>Benjamin Hough, of Clarendon, was a
troublesome New York justice. His neighbors
seized him and carried him thirty miles south
in a sleigh. After three days, January 30,
1775, he was tried in Sunderland before Allen
and others. His punishment was two hundred
lashes on the naked back while he was
tied to a tree. Allen and Warner signed a
written certificate as a burlesque passport for
Hough to New York, "he behaving as becometh."</p>

<p>At this time the following open letters from
the Green Mountain Boys were published:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An epistle to the inhabitants of Clarendon:
From Mr. Francis Madison of your town, I under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>stand
Oliver Colvin of your town has acted the
infamous part by locating part of the farm of said
Madison. This sort of trick I was partly apprised
of, when I wrote the late letter to Messrs. Spencer
and Marsh. I abhor to put a staff into the
hands of Colvin or any other rascal to defraud your
letter. The Hampshire title must, nay shall, be
had for such settlers as are in quest of it, at a
reasonable rate, nor shall any villain by a sudden
purchase impose on the old settlers. I advise said
Colvin to be flogged for the abuse aforesaid, unless
he immediately retracts and reforms, and if there
be further difficulties among you, I advise that
you employ Capt. Warner as an arbitrator in your
affairs. I am certain he will do all parties justice.
Such candor you need in your present situation,
for I assure you, it is not the design of our mobs
to betray you into the hands of villainous purchasers.
None but blockheads would purchase
your farms, and they must be treated as such. If
this letter does not settle this dispute, you had
better hire Captain Warner to come simply and
assist you in the settlement of your affairs. My
business is such that I cannot attend to your matters
in person, but desire you would inform me,
by writing or otherwise relative thereto. Captain
Baker joins with the foregoing, and does me the
honor to subscribe his name with me. We are,
gentlemen, your friends to serve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;On my return from what you

fearing that the force of our arms would urge you
to purchase the New Hampshire title at an unreasonable
rate, tho' at the same time I know not
but after the force is withdrawn, you will want a
third army. However, on proviso, you incline to
purchase the title aforesaid, it is my opinion, that
you in justice ought to have it at a reasonable rate,
as new lands were valued at the time you purchased
them. This, with sundry other arguments
in your behalf, I laid before Captain Jehiel Hawley
and other respectable gentlemen of that place
(Arlington) and by their advice and concurrence,
I write you this friendly epistle unto which they
subscribe their names with me, that we are disposed
to assist you in purchasing reasonably as

<p>The convention had decreed that no officer
from New York should attempt to take any
person out of its territory, on penalty of a
severe punishment, and it forbade any surveyor
to run lines through the lands or inspect
them with that purpose. This edict enlarged
the powers of the military commanders, and it
was their duty to search out such offenders.
The Committees of Safety which were chosen
were entrusted with powers for regulating
local affairs, and the conventions of delegates
representing the people, which assembled from
time to time, adopted measures tending to harmony
and concentration of effort.</p>

<p>May 19, 1772 (the year in which occurred
Poland's first dismemberment), Governor Tryon
wrote to Bennington and vicinity, inviting
the citizens to send delegates to him and explain
the causes of their opposition to New
York rule. Could anything be fairer or more
politic and wise? He promised safety to any
and all sent, except four of their leaders, Allen,
Warner, Cochran, and Sevil, and suggested
sending their pastor, J. Dewey, and Mr. Fay.
Dewey answered on June 5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, his Majesty's leal and loyal subjects of
the Province of New York.... First, we hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fee of our land by grants of George II., and
George III., the lands reputed then in New Hampshire.
Since 1764, New York has granted the
same land as though the fee of the land and property
was altered with jurisdiction, which we
suppose was not.... Suits of law for our lands
rejecting our proof of title, refusing time to
get our evidence are the grounds of our discontent....
Breaking houses for possession of them
and their owners, firing on these people and
wounding innocent women and children....
We must closely adhere to the maintaining our
property with a due submission to Your Excellency's
jurisdiction.... We pray and beseech
Your Excellency would assist to quiet us
in our possessions, till his Majesty in his royal
wisdom shall be graciously pleased to settle the
controversy.</p></div>

<p>Allen, not being allowed to go to New York,
wrote to Tryon in conjunction with Warner,
Baker, and Cochran, stating the case as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No consideration whatever, shall induce us to
remit in the least of our loyalty and gratitude to
our most Gracious Sovereign, and reasonably to
you; yet no tyranny shall deter us from asserting
and vindicating our rights and privileges as Englishmen.
We expect an answer to our humble
petition, delivered you soon after you became
Governor, but in vain. We assent to your jurisdiction,
because it is the King's will, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
have, except where perverse use would deprive us
of our property and country. We desire and petition
to be reannexed to New Hampshire. That is
not the principal cause we object to, but we think
change made by fraud, unconstitutional exercise of
it. The New York patentees got judgments, took
out writs, and actually dispossessed several by
order of law, of their houses and farms and necessaries.
These families spent their fortunes in bringing
wilderness into fruitful fields, gardens and
orchards. Over fifteen hundred families ejected,
if five and one-quarter persons are allowed to
each family.... The writs of ejectment come
thicker and faster.... Nobody can be supposed
under law if law does not protect....
Since our misfortune of being annexed to New
York, law is a tool to cheat us.... Fatigued
in settling a wilderness country.... As our
cause is before the King, we do not expect you to
determine it.... If we don't oppose Sheriff,
he takes our houses and farms. If we do, we are
indicted rioters. If our friends help us, they are
indicted rioters. As to refugees, self-preservation
necessitated our treating some of them roughly.
Ebenezer Cowle and Jonathan Wheat, of Shaftsbury,
fled to New York, because of their own
guilt, they not being hurt nor threatened. John
Munro, Esq., and ruffians, assaulting Baker at daybreak,
March 22, was a notorious riot, cutting,
wounding and maiming Mr. Baker, his wife and
children. As Baker is alive he has no cause of
complaint. Later he (Munro) assaulted Warner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
who, with a dull cutlass, struck him on the head
to the ground. As laws are made by our enemies,
we could not bring Munro to justice otherwise
than by mimicing him, and treating him as he did
Baker, and so forth. Bliss Willoughby, feigning
business, went to Baker's house and reported to
Munro, thus instigating and planning the attack....
The alteration of jurisdiction in 1764 could
not affect private property.... The transferring
or alienation of property is a sacred prerogative
of the true owner. Kings and Governors
cannot intermeddle therewith.... We have a
petition lying before his Majesty and Council for
redress of our grievances for several years past.
In Moore's time, the King forbid New York to
patent any lands before granted by New Hampshire.
This a supercedeas of Common Law.
King notifying New York he takes cognizance
and will settle and forbids New York to meddle:
common sense teaches a common law, judgment
after that, if it prevailed, would be subversive of
royal authority. So all officers coming to dispossess
are violaters of law. Right and wrong are
externally the same. We are not opposing you
and your Government, but a party chiefly attorneys.
We hear you applied to assembly for
armed force to subdue us in vain. We choose
Captain Stephen Fay and Mr. Jonas Fay, to treat
with you in person. We entreat your aid to quiet
us in our farms till the King decides it.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>The embassy was successful. The council
advised that all legal processes against Vermont
should cease. If Bennington was happy
in May over the invitation, Bennington was jubilant
in August over the kindly advice. The
air rang with shouts; the health of governor
and council was drunk and cannon and small-arms
were heard everywhere. No part of New
York colony was happier or more devotedly
British. Two years had passed since the New
York Supreme Court had adjudged all the Vermont
legal documents null and void: one year
had passed since New York had sent a sheriff
and posse with hundreds of citizens to force
Vermont farmers from their farms, but both
of these affairs occurred under Governor Clinton.
Now perhaps, the Vermonters thought,
the new governor was going to act fairly: there
would be no more fights; no more watching and
guarding against midnight attacks; no more
need of fire-arms; and wives and babes would
be safe. There would be no more kidnapping
of Green Mountain Boys and hurrying them
away to Albany jail; no more foreign surveying
of the lands they tilled and loved.</p>

<p class="pfs70">THE RAID UPON COLONEL REID'S SETTLERS.&mdash;ALLEN'S
OUTLAWRY.&mdash;CREAN BRUSH.&mdash;PHILIP SKENE.</p>


<p>But "best laid schemes of mice and men
gang aft agley." While these negotiations
were pending, New Yorkers were quietly doing
the necessary work for stealing more Vermont
lands. Cockburn, the Scotch New York
surveyor, was surveying land along Otter
Creek. The Green Mountain Boys heard of
it, rallied, and overtook him near Vergennes,
and found Colonel Reid's Scotchmen enjoying
mills and farms. For three years these
foreigners had been there. In 1769, with no
legal title, they had found, seized, and enjoyed
the land, with a mill. Vermonters had then
rallied and dispossessed these dispossessors,
but a second raid of Reid's men redispossessed
them. In the summer of 1772, Vermont,
seizing Cockburn, turned out Reid's
tenants, broke up mill-stones and threw them
over the falls, razed houses, and burned crops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scotch story is as follows: John Cameron
made affidavit that he and some other
families from Scotland arrived at New York
in the latter part of June, and a few days afterward
agreed with Lieutenant-Colonel Reid to
settle as tenants on his lands on Otter Creek,
in Charlotte County. Reid went with them
to Otter Creek, some miles east from Crown
Point, and was at considerable expense in
transporting them, their wives, children, and
baggage. The day after their arrival at Otter
Creek they were viewing the land, where they
saw a crop of Indian corn, wheat, and garden
stuff, and a stack of hay and two New England
men. Reid paid these two men $15 for their
crops, the men agreeing to leave until the
king's pleasure should be known. Reid made
over these crops to his new tenants, gave
them possession of the land in presence of two
justices of the peace of Charlotte County, and
bought some provisions and cows for his
tenants. On or about the 11th of August,
armed men from different parts of the country
came and turned James Henderson and others
out of their homes, burnt the houses to the
ground, and for two days pastured fifty horses
which they had brought with them in a field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
corn which Reid had bought. They also burnt
a large stack of hay, purchased by Reid.
The next day the rioters, headed by their captains,
Allen, Baker, and Warner, came to
Cameron's house, destroyed the new grist-mill,
built by Reid (Baker insisting upon it), broke
the mill-stones in pieces and threw them down
a precipice into the river. The rioters then
turned out Cameron's wife and two small
children, and burnt the house, having in the
two days burnt five houses, two corn shades,
and one stack of hay. When Cameron, much
incensed, asked by what authority of law they
committed such violences, Baker replied that
they lived out of the bounds of law, and holding
up his gun said that was his law. He
further declared that they were resolved never
to allow any persons claiming under New York
to settle in that part of the province, but if
Cameron would join them, they would give
him lands for nothing. This offer Cameron
rejected. While the rioters were destroying his
house and mill on the Crown Point (west) side
of Otter Creek, he heard six men ordered to
go with arms and stand as sentinels on a rising
ground toward Crown Point, to prevent any
surprise from the troops in the garrison there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Having destroyed Cameron's house and the
mill, the rioters recrossed the river. Cameron
reports that he saw among the rioters Joshua
Hide, who had agreed in writing with Reid
not to return, and had received payment for
his crop. Hide was very active in advising
the destruction of Cameron's house and the
mill.</p>

<p>Cameron stayed about three weeks at Otter
Creek, after the rioters dispersed, hoping to
hear from Reid, and hoping also that New
York would protect him and his fellow-settlers,
but having no house, and being exposed to the
night air, the fever and ague soon compelled
him to retire. Some of his companions went
before, the rest were to follow. What became
of his wife and children he does not state.
Cameron stayed one night at the house of a
Mr. Irwin, on the east shore of the lake, five
miles north of Crown Point. Irwin, an elderly
man, holding a New Hampshire title, told
Cameron that Reid had a narrow escape, for
Baker with eight men had laid in wait for him
a whole day, near the mouth of Otter Creek,
determined to murder him, and the men in the
boat with him, on their way back to Crown
Point, so that none might remain to tell tales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Fortunately Reid had left the day before. Irwin
disapproved of such bloody intentions, and
said if his land was confirmed to a Yorker, he
would either buy the Yorker's title or move
off.</p>

<p>James Henderson, settler under Colonel
Reid, deposed that on Wednesday, August 11,
he and three others of Colonel Reid's settlers
were at work at their hay in the meadow,
when twenty men, armed with guns, swords,
and pistols, surprised them. They inquired
if Henderson and his companions lived in the
house some time before occupied by Joshua
Hide. They replied no, the men who lived
in that house were about their business. The
rioters then told Henderson and his companions
that they must go along with them (as they
could not understand the women), and marched
them prisoners, guarded before and behind
like criminals, to the house, where they joined
the rest of the mob, in number about one hundred
or more, all armed as before, and who,
as Henderson was told by the women, had let
their horses loose in the corn and wheat that
Reid had bought for his settlers. The mob
desired the things to be taken out of the
house, and then set the house on fire. Ethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Allen, the ringleader or captain, then ordered
part of his gang to go with Henderson to his
own house (formerly built and occupied by
Captain Gray) in order to prepare it for the
same fate. Henderson and his wife earnestly
requested the mob to spare their house for a
few days, in order to save their effects and
protect their children from the inclemency
of the weather, until they could have an opportunity
of removing themselves to some
safe place; but Captain Allen, coming up from
the fore-mentioned house, told them that his
business required haste; for he and his gang
were determined not to leave a house belonging
to Colonel Reid standing. Then the mob
set fire to and entirely consumed Henderson's
house. Henderson took out his memorandum
book and desired to know their ringleader's
or captain's name. The captain answered:
"Who gave you authority to ask for my
name?" Henderson replied that as he took
him to be the ringleader of the mob, and as he
had in such a riotous and unlawful manner
dispossessed him, he had a right to ask his
name, that he might represent him to Colonel
Reid, who had put him, Henderson, in peaceable
possession of the premises as his just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
property. Allen answered, he wished they
had caught Colonel Reid; they would have
whipped him severely; that his name was
Ethan Allen, captain of that mob, and that
his authority was his own arms, pointing to
his gun; that he and his companions were a
lawless mob, their law being mob law. Henderson
replied that the law was made for lawless
and riotous people, and that he must know
it was death by the law to ringleaders of
rioters and lawless mobs. Allen answered
that he had run these woods in the same manner
these seven years past [this would carry
it back to the year 1766, when Zadoc Thompson
says Allen's family was living in Sheffield]
and never was caught yet; and he told Henderson
that if any of Colonel Reid's settlers
offered hereafter to build any house and keep
possession, the Green Mountain Boys, as they
call themselves, would burn their houses and
whip them into the bargain. The mob then
burnt the house formerly built and occupied
by Lewis Stewart, and remained that night
about Leonard's house. The next day, about
seven <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, August 12, Henderson went to
Leonard's house. The mob were all drawn
up, consulting about destroying the mill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Those who were in favor of it were ordered
to follow Captain Allen. In the mean time
Baker and his gang came to the opposite side
of the river and fired their guns. They were
brought over at once, and while they were
taking some refreshment, Allen's party
marched to the mill, but did not break up
any part of it until Allen joined them. The
two mobs having joined (by their own account
one hundred and fifty in number), with
axes, crow-bars, and handspikes tore the mill
to pieces, broke the mill-stones and threw them
into the creek. Baker came out of the mill
with the bolt-cloth in his hands. With his
sword he cut it in pieces and distributed it
among the mob to wear in their hats like cockades,
as trophies of the victory. Henderson
told Baker he was about very disagreeable
work. Baker replied it was so, but he had a
commission for so doing, and showed Henderson
where his thumb had been cut off,
which he called his commission.</p>

<p>Angus McBean, settler under Colonel Reid,
deposed that between seven and eight <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>,
Thursday, August 12 last, he met a part of
the New England mob about Leonard's house,
sixty men or thereabouts, he supposed, armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with guns, swords, and pistols. One of them
asked Angus if he were one of Colonel Reid's
new settlers, and having been told he was,
asked him what he intended to do. McBean
replied he intended to build himself a house
and keep possession of the land. He was then
asked if he intended to keep possession for
Colonel Reid. He replied yes, as long as he
could. Soon after their chief leader, Allen,
came and asked him if he was the man that
said he would keep possession for Colonel Reid.
McBean said yes. Allen then damned his
soul, but he would have him, McBean, tied to
a tree and skinned alive, if he ever attempted
such a thing. Allen and several of the mob
said, if they could but catch Colonel Reid,
they would cut his head off. Joshua Hide,
one of the persons of whom Colonel Reid
bought the crop, advised the mob to tear down
or burn the houses of Donald McIntosh and
John Burdan, as they both had been assisting
Colonel Reid. Soon after several guns were
fired on the other side of the creek. Some of
the mob said that was Captain Baker and his
party coming to see the sport. Soon Baker
and his party joined the mob, and all went to
tear down the grist-mill. McBean thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Baker was one of the first that entered the
mill.</p>

<p>However strong our indignation at the New
York usurpations, we cannot read of the violent
ejectment of families without a feeling of
repugnance to such a method. Turn to the
vivid and romantic account of Colonel Reid's
settlement in "The Tory's Daughter," and remember
that in civil strife the innocent must
often suffer. The Green Mountain Boys' immunity
from the penalty of the law for their
riotous acts shows not only their adroitness,
but suggests half-heartedness in their pursuit.
Laws not supported by public sentiment are
rarely enforced.</p>

<p>John Munroe wrote to Duane during the
Clarendon proceedings:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rioters have a great many friends in the
county of Albany, and particularly in the city of
Albany, which encourages them in their wickedness,
at the same time hold offices under the Government,
and pretend to be much against them,
but at heart I know them to be otherwise, for the
rioters have often told me, that be it known to me,
that they had more friends in Albany than I had,
which I believe to be true.</p></div>

<p>Hugh Munro lived near the west line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Shaftsbury. He took Surveyor Campbell to
survey land in Rupert for him. He was seized
by Cochran, who said he was a son of Robin
Hood, and beaten. Ira Allen says Munro
fainted from whipping by bush twigs. Munro
had not a savory reputation with the Vermonters.
After Tryon's offer of a reward for the
arrest of Allen, Baker, and Cochran, he, with
ten or twelve other men, had seized Baker,
who lived ten or twelve miles from him, a
mile east of Arlington. After a march of sixteen
miles, they were met by ten Bennington
men, who arrested Munro and Constable Stevens,
the rest of the party fleeing. Later Warner
and one man rode to Munro's and asked
for Baker's gun. Munro refused, and seizing
Warner's bridle ordered the constable to arrest
Warner, who drew his cutlass and felled
Munro to the ground. For this act of Warner's,
Poultney voted him one hundred acres
of land April 4, 1773.</p>

<p>In 1774 Allen published a pamphlet of over
two hundred pages, in which he rehearsed
many historical facts tending to show that
previous to the royal order of 1764, New
York had no claim to extend easterly to the
Connecticut River. He portrayed in strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
light the oppressive conduct of New York
toward the settlers. This pamphlet also contained
the answer of himself and of his associates
to the Act of Outlawry of March, 1774.
Another man was busy this year drawing up
reports of the trouble in Vermont.</p>

<p>Crean Brush, the first Vermont lawyer, was
a colonel, a native of Dublin. In 1762 he
came to New York and became assistant secretary
of the colony; in 1771-74 he practised
law in Westminster, Vt. He claimed thousands
of Vermont acres under New York titles,
and became county clerk, surrogate, and provincial
member of Congress. He was in Boston
jail nineteen months for plundering Boston
whigs, and finally escaped in his wife's dress.
The British commander in New York told
him his conduct merited more punishment.
A Yorker, always fighting the Green Mountain
Boys; a tory, always fighting the whigs;
with fair culture and talent, he became a sot,
and, at the age of fifty-three, in 1778, he blew
his brains out, in New York City. He left a
step-daughter who became the second wife of
Ethan Allen.</p>

<p>On February 5, 1774, Brush reported to the
New York Legislature resolutions to the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
"that riotousness exists in part of Charlotte
County and northeast Albany County, calling
for redress; that a Bennington mob has terrorized
officers, rescued debtors, assumed military
command and judicial power, burned
houses, beat citizens, expelled thousands,
stopped the administration of justice; that
anti-rioters are in danger in person and property
and need protection. Wherefore the
Governor is petitioned to offer fifty pounds
reward for the apprehension and lodgment in
Albany jail of Ethan Allen, Seth Warner, Remember
Baker, Robert Cochran, Peleg Sunderland,
Silvanus Brown, James Breakenridge,
and John Smith, either or any of them." It
was ordered that Brush and Colonel Ten Eyck
report a bill for the suppression of riotous and
disorderly proceedings. Captain Delaney and
Mr. Walton were appointed to present the address
and resolutions to the governor.</p>

<p>A committee met March 1, 1774, at Eliakim
Weller's house in Manchester, adjourning to
the third Wednesday at Captain Jehial Hawley's
in Arlington. Nathan Clark was chairman
of the committee and Jonas Clark clerk.
The <cite>New York Mercury</cite>, No. 1,163, with the
foregoing report in it, was produced and read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Seven of the committee were chosen to examine
it and prepare a report, which was adopted
and ordered published in the public papers.
They speak of their misfortune in being annexed
to New York, and hope that the king
will adopt the report of the Board of Trade,
made December 3, 1772. In consequence,
hundreds of settled families, many of them
comparatively wealthy, resolved to defend the
outlawed men. All were ready at a minute's
warning. They resolved to act on the defensive
only, and to encourage the execution of law
in civil cases and in real criminal cases. They
advised the General Assembly to wait for the
king's decision. The committee declared that
they were all loyal to their political father; but
that as they bought of the first governor appointed
by the king, on the faith of the crown,
they will maintain those grants; that New
York has acted contrary to the spirit of the
good laws of Great Britain. This declaration
was certified by the chairman and clerk, at
Bennington, April 14, 1774.</p>

<p>It was in 1774 that a new plan was formed
for escaping from the government of New
York; a plan that startles us by its audacity and
its comprehensiveness. This was to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a new royal colony extending from the Connecticut
to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence,
from forty-five degrees of north latitude to
Massachusetts and the Mohawk River. The
plan was formed by Allen and other Vermonters.
At that time Colonel Philip Skene, a retired
British officer, was living at Whitehall
on a large patent of land. To him the Vermonters
communicated the project. Whitehall
was to be the capital and Skene the governor
of the projected colony. Skene, at his
own expense, went to London, and was appointed
governor of Ticonderoga and Crown
Point, but the course of public events prevented
the completion of this scheme.</p>

<p class="pfs70">PREPARATIONS TO CAPTURE TICONDEROGA.&mdash;DIARY
OF EDWARD MOTT.&mdash;EXPEDITIONS PLANNED.&mdash;BENEDICT
ARNOLD.&mdash;GERSHOM BEACH.</p>


<p>On March 29, 1775, John Brown, a Massachusetts
lawyer, wrote from Montreal to Boston:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people on the New Hampshire Grants have
engaged to seize the fort at Ticonderoga as soon
as possible, should hostilities be committed by the
king's troops.</p></div>

<p>The most minute account of the preparations
to capture Ticonderoga is furnished by
the diary for April, 1775, of Edward Mott, of
Preston, Conn., a captain in Colonel S. H.
Parson's regiment. He had been at the camp
of the American army beleaguering Boston;
took charge of the expedition to seize Ticonderoga;
reported its success to Governor
Trumbull at Hartford; was sent by Trumbull
to Congress at Philadelphia with the
news; resumed the command of his company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
at Ticonderoga in May; was with the Northern
army during the campaign; was at the
taking of Chambly and St. Johns; and became
a major in Colonel Gray's regiment next year.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Preston</span>, Friday, April 28, 1775.</p>

<p>Set out for Hartford, where I arrived the same
day. Saw Christopher Leffingwell, who inquired
of me about the situation of the people at Boston.
When I had given him an account, he asked me
how they could be relieved and where I thought
we could get artillery and stores. I told him I
knew not unless we went and took possession of
Ticonderoga and Crown Point, which I thought
might be done by surprise with a small number of
men. Mr. Leffingwell left me and in a short time
came to me again, and brought with him Samuel
H. Parsons and Silas Deane, Esqrs. When he
asked me if I would undertake in such an expedition
as we had talked of before, I told him I
would. They told me they wished I had been
there one day sooner; that they had been on such
a plan; and that they had sent off Messrs. Noah
Phelps and Bernard Romans, whom they had supplied
with £300 in cash from the treasury, and
ordered them to draw for more if they should need;
that said Phelps and Romans had gone by the way
of Salisbury, where they would make a stop. They
expected a small number of men would join them,
and if I would go after them they would give me
an order or letter to them to join with them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to have my voice with them in conducting the
affair and in laying out the money; and also that
I might take five or six men with me. On which
I took with me Mr. Jeremiah Halsey, Mr. Epaphras
Bull, Mr. Wm. Nichols, Mr. Elijah Babcock, and
John Bigelow joined me; and Saturday, the 29th
of April, in the afternoon, we set out on said expedition.
Mr. Babcock tired his horse. We got
another horse of Esq. Humphrey in Norfolk, and
that day arrived at Salisbury; tarried all night,
and the next day, having augmented our company
to the number of sixteen in the whole, we concluded
it was not best to add any more, as we meant
to keep our business a secret and ride through
the country unarmed till we came to the New
Settlements on the Grants. We arrived at Mr.
Dewey's in Sheffield, and there we sent off Mr.
Jer. Halsey and Capt. John Stevens to go to Albany,
in order to discover the temper of the people
in that place, and to return and inform us as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>That night (Monday the 1st of May) we arrived
at Col. Easton's in Pittsfield, where we fell in company
with John Brown, Esq., who had been at
Canada and Ticonderoga about a month before; on
which we concluded to make known our business
to Col. Easton and said Brown and to take their
advice on the same. I was advised by Messrs.
Deane, Leffingwell, and Parsons not to raise our
men till we came to the New Hampshire Grants,
lest we should be discovered by having too long a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
march through the country. But when we advised
with the said Easton and Brown they advised
us that, as there was a great scarcity of provisions
in the Grants, and as the people were generally
poor, it would be difficult to get a sufficient number
of men there; therefore we had better raise a
number of men sooner. Said Easton and Brown
concluded to go with us, and Easton said he would
assist me in raising some men in his regiment.
We then concluded for me to go with Col. Easton
to Jericho and Williamstown to raise men, and
the rest of us to go forward to Bennington and
see if they could purchase provisions there.</p>

<p>We raised twenty-four men in Jericho and fifteen
in Williamstown; got them equipped ready
to march. Then Col. Easton and I set out for Bennington.
That evening we met with an express
for our people informing us that they had seen a
man directly from Ticonderoga and he informed
them that they were re-enforced at Ticonderoga,
and were repairing the garrison, and were every
way on their guard; therefore it was best for us
to dismiss the men we had raised and proceed no
further, as we should not succeed. I asked who
the man was, where he belonged, and where he
was going, but could get no account; on which I
ordered that the men should not be dismissed, but
that we should proceed. The next day I arrived
at Bennington. There overtook our people, all
but Mr. Noah Phelps and Mr. Heacock, who were
gone forward to reconnoitre the fort: and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Halsey and Mr. Stevens had not got back from
Albany.</p></div>

<p>The following account of expenses incurred
on this expedition is amusing, pitiful, and interesting,

of the Revolution, and as compared with the
machinery of transportation and the wealth of
the nation in its Civil War:</p>

<p>The 3d of May, 1775, is an eventful day.
Four scenes interest us. At Albany there is
hesitation. Halsey and Stevens have been
there to obtain permission for the Ticonderoga
expedition. The Albany committee-men
are alarmed, for the proposition seems to
be hazardous. What will the New York Congress
think of it? Will the next Continental
Congress, to meet seven days hence, approve
of it? The committee write to the New York
Congress for instructions, suggesting that if
New York goes in for the invasion it will
plunge northern New York into all the horrors
of war.</p>

<p>A second scene is at Cambridge. The Committee
of Safety, without waiting for permission
from New York, decided to act. They
issue a commission to Arnold without consulting
the Massachusetts Congress, and authorize
him to raise four hundred men in western
Massachusetts and near colonies for the capture
of Ticonderoga and Crown Point; they
give him money and authority to seize and
send military stores to Massachusetts. We
can imagine Arnold quickly in the saddle, for
the enterprise suits his genius.</p>

<p>Benedict Arnold was now thirty-five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
old; educated in the common schools, apprenticed
as a druggist, fond of mischief,
cruel, irritable, reckless of his reputation,
ambitious and uncontrollable. As a boy he
loved to maim young birds, placed broken
glass where school-children would cut their
feet, and enticed them with presents and then
rushed out and horsewhipped them. He
would cling to the arms of a large water-wheel
at the grist-mill and thus pass beneath and
above the water. When sixteen years of age
he enlisted as a soldier, was released; enlisted
again, was at Ticonderoga and other frontier
forts; deserted; served out his apprenticeship,
became a druggist and general merchant in
New Haven; shipped horses, cattle, and provisions
to the West Indies, commanded his
own vessels, fought a duel with a Frenchman
in the West Indies, became a bankrupt, and
was suspected of dishonesty. Fertile in resource,
he resumed business with energy but
with the same obliquity of moral purpose.</p>

<p>With sixty volunteers, a few of them Yale
students, marching from New Haven to Cambridge,
he had an interview with Colonel
Samuel H. Parsons near Hartford the 27th of
April, and told him about the cannon and am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>munition
at Ticonderoga and the defenceless
condition of that fort. Such was the man who
endeavored to wrest the command of the expedition
from Allen.</p>

<p>But the grandest scene of all on that 3d of
May is the assemblage in Bennington, perhaps
in the old Catamount Tavern of Stephen
Fay. Allen, Warner, Robinson, Dr. Jonas Fay,
Joseph Fay, Breakenridge are there with fifteen
Connecticut men and thirty-nine Massachusetts
men. Easton's Massachusetts men outnumber
Warner's recruits, and Warner ranks third
instead of second. No one dreams of any one
but Allen for the leader. Easton is also complimented
by being made chairman of the
council. Allen with his usual energy takes
the initiative and leaves the party to raise
more men. He has been gone but a short
time when Benedict Arnold arrives on horseback
with one attendant at the hamlet and
camp of Castleton. He sees Nott and other
officers. They frankly communicate to him all
their plans, and are in turn astounded by
Arnold's claiming the right to take command
of their whole force. He shows them his commission
from the Committee of Safety in Cambridge,
Mass. This paper gave authority to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
enlist men, but no more power over these men
than any other American volunteers. Arnold's
temper brooked no opposition. There is almost
a mutiny among the men. They would
go home, abandon the whole expedition which
had so enkindled their enthusiasm, rather than
be subject to Arnold. Whether this was
owing to his domineering temper as exhibited
before them, to his reputation in Connecticut
as an unprincipled man, or entirely to their
regard for their own officers and aversion
to others, we can only conjecture. Tuesday
morning this wrangling is resumed. Again
the soldiers threaten to club their guns and
go home. When told that they should be paid
the same, although Arnold did command them,
they would "damn" their pay. But Arnold suddenly
started to leave this company and overtake
Allen. The soldiers, knowing Allen's
good-nature, as suddenly leave Castleton and
follow Arnold to prevent his overpersuading
Allen to yield to his arrogance.</p>

<p>When this stampede occurred, Nott and
Phelps with Herrick were with the thirty
men on the march to Skenesborough. They
left the Remington camp at Castleton, and
had gone nearly to Hydeville. The stampede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
left all the provisions at Castleton, so that
Nott and Phelps were obliged to return to
Castleton, gather up the provisions, and follow
the main party to Ticonderoga. They arrived
in Shoreham too late to take part in the capture,
but crossed the lake with Warner. This
incident deprives us of the benefit of Nott's
journal account of the capture itself, a loss to
be deplored. Some time Tuesday, somewhere
between Castleton and the lake, Allen and
Arnold met, and the scene occurred which has
been so often and so well told in romance and
history.</p>

<p>Within three weeks after the world-renowned
19th of April, 1775, Ethan stood in Castleton
with an old friend by his side, Gershom Beach,
of Rutland, a whig blacksmith, intelligent,
capable, and true. Besides some sixty Massachusetts
and Connecticut allies, Allen is surrounded
by from one to two hundred Green
Mountain Boys. More men were wanted, and
Beach was selected from the willing and eager
crowd to go, like Roderick Dhu's messenger
with the Cross of Fire, o'er hill and dale,
across brook and swamp, from Castleton to
Rutland, Pittsford, Brandon, Middlebury, and
Shoreham. The distance was sixty miles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
time allowed twenty-four hours, the rallying-point
a ravine at Hand's Point, Shoreham.
Paul Revere rode on a good steed, over good
roads, on a moonlight night, in a few hours.
Gershom Beach went on foot, crossed Otter
Creek twice, forded West Creek, East Creek,
Furnace Brook, Neshobe River, Leicester
River, Middlebury River, and walked through
forests choked with underbrush, but at the end
of the day allotted the men were warned and
were hastening to the rendezvous. Then and
not till then Beach threw himself on the
ground and gave himself up to well-earned
sleep. Let us give this hero his full meed
of praise. After a few hours' rest he followed
the men whom he had aroused and
joined Allen.</p>

<p class="pfs70">CAPTURE OF TICONDEROGA.</p>


<p>In the gray of the morning, Wednesday,
May 10, 1775, Ethan Allen with eighty-three
Green Mountain Boys crossed the lake. He
frankly told his followers of the danger, but
every gun was poised to dare that danger. Soon
three huzzas rang out on the parade-ground of
the sleeping fort. The English captain, De
Laplace, not knowing that his nation had an
enemy on this continent, asked innocently by
what authority his surrender was demanded.
Need I repeat the answer? No words in the
language are more familiar than Allen's reply.
The British colors were trailed before a power
that had no national flag for more than two
years afterward. A few hours later, that same
day, the second session of the Continental Congress
began at Philadelphia, the members all
unaware and soon in part disapproving of this
exploit of Allen's. The graphic account by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the hero's own, pen is more life-like than that
of any historian:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first systematical and bloody attempt at
Lexington to enslave America thoroughly electrified
my mind, and fully determined me to take
part with my country. And while I was wishing
for an opportunity to signalize myself in its behalf,
directions were privately sent to me from the
then colony of Connecticut to raise the Green
Mountain Boys, and if possible with them to surprise
and take the fortress of Ticonderoga. This
enterprise I cheerfully undertook; and after first
guarding all the passes that led thither, to cut off
all intelligence between the garrison and the country,
made a forced march from Bennington and arrived
at the lake opposite to Ticonderoga on the
evening of the ninth day of May, 1775, with two
hundred and thirty valiant Green Mountain Boys.</p>

<p>It was with the utmost difficulty that I procured
boats to cross the lake. However, I landed eighty-three
men near the garrison, and sent the boats
back for the rear guard, commanded by Col. Seth
Warner, but the day began to dawn and I found
myself under a necessity to attack the fort before
the rear could cross the lake, and, as it was viewed
hazardous, I harangued the officers and soldiers
in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Friends and fellow-soldiers, you have for a
number of years past been a scourge and terror to
arbitrary power. Your valor has been famed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
abroad and acknowledged, as appears by the advice
and orders to me from the General Assembly
of Connecticut to surprise and take the garrison
now before us. I now propose to advance before
you, and in person conduct you through the wicket-gate;
for we must this morning either quit our
pretensions to valor or possess ourselves of this
fortress in a few minutes; and inasmuch as it is
a desperate attempt which none but the bravest
of men dare undertake, I do not urge it on any contrary
to his will. You that will undertake voluntarily,
poise your firelocks."</p>

<p>The men being at this time drawn up in three
ranks, each poised his firelock. I ordered them to
face to the right, and at the head of the centre file
marched them immediately to the wicket-gate
aforesaid, where I found a sentry posted who instantly
snapped his fusee at me. I ran immediately
toward him, and he retreated through the
covered way into the parade within the garrison,
gave a halloo, and ran under a bomb-proof. My
party who followed me into the fort I formed on
the parade in such a manner as to face the two barracks,
which faced each other. The garrison being
asleep, except the sentries, we gave three huzzas,
which greatly surprised them. One of the sentries
made a pass at one of my officers with a charge
bayonet, and slightly wounded him. My first
thought was to kill him with my sword, but in an
instant I altered the design and fury of the blow
to a slight cut on the side of the head; upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he dropped his gun and asked quarter, which I
readily granted him, and demanded of him the
place where the commanding officer kept.</p>

<p>He showed me a pair of stairs in front of the
barrack, on the west part of the garrison, which
led up to a second story in said barrack, to which
I immediately repaired, and ordered the commander,
Captain De la Place, to come forth instantly,
or I would sacrifice the whole garrison;
at which the captain came immediately to the
door with his breeches in his hand, when I ordered
him to deliver me the fort instantly; he asked me
by what authority I demanded it; I answered him,
In the name of the great Jehovah and the Continental
Congress. The authority of the Congress
being very little known at that time, he began to
speak again, but I interrupted him, and with my
drawn sword over his head again demanded an
immediate surrender of the garrison: with which
he then complied and ordered his men to be forthwith
paraded without arms, as he had given up
the garrison.</p>

<p>In the mean time some of my officers had given
orders, and in consequence thereof sundry of the
barrack doors were beaten down, and about one-third
of the garrison imprisoned, which consisted
of the said commander, a Lieut. Feltham, a conducter
of artillery, a gunner, two sergeants, and
forty-four rank and file: about one hundred pieces
of cannon, one thirteen-inch mortar, and a number
of swords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>This surprise was carried into execution in the
gray of the morning of the tenth day of May, 1775.
The sun seemed to rise that morning with a superior
lustre: and Ticonderoga and its dependencies
smiled on its conquerors, who tossed about
the flowing bowl, and wished success to Congress,
and the liberty and freedom of America. Happy
it was for me at that time, that the then future
pages of the book of fate, which afterwards unfolded
a miserable scene of two years and eight
months' imprisonment, were hid from my view.
But to return to my narrative. Col. Warner, with
the rear guard, crossed the lake and joined me
early in the morning, whom I sent off without loss
of time with about one hundred men to take possession
of Crown Point, which was garrisoned with
a sergeant and twelve men; which he took possession
of the same day, as also of upwards of one
hundred pieces of cannon.</p></div>

<p>The soldierly qualities exhibited by Allen
in the expedition seem to have been, first,
reticence or concealment of purpose from the
enemy; second, power of commanding enthusiastic
obedience from his men; third, adaptation
of means to object; fourth, alacrity; and, fifth,
courage. Success gave a brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> to this
effort, which time has only served to render
more brilliant.</p>

<p>The following letters written by Allen fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>nish
us with additional information which
makes the whole affair stand out vividly for
nineteenth-century readers:</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>To the Massachusetts Congress.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have to inform you with pleasure
unfelt before, that on break of day of the 10th of
May, 1775, by the order of the General Assembly
of the Colony of Connecticut, I took the fortress of
Ticonderoga by storm. The soldiery was composed
of about one hundred Green Mountain Boys
and near fifty veteran soldiers from the Province
of the Massachusetts Bay. The latter was under
the command of Col. James Easton, who behaved
with great zeal and fortitude not only in council,
but in the assault. The soldiery behaved
with such resistless fury, that they so terrified the
King's Troops that they durst not fire on their assailants,
and our soldiery was agreeably disappointed.
The soldiery behaved with uncommon
rancour when they leaped into the Fort: and it
must be confessed that the Colonel has greatly
contributed to the taking of that Fortress, as well
as John Brown, Esq. Attorney at Law, who was
also an able counsellor, and was personally in the
attack. I expect the Colonies will maintain this
Fort. As to the cannon and warlike stores, I hope
they may serve the cause of liberty instead of
tyranny, and I humbly implore your assistance in
immediately assisting the Government of Connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>icut

of Capt. Herrick has took possession of
Skenesborough, imprisoned Major Skene, and
seized a schooner of his. I expect in ten days
time to have it rigged, manned, and armed with
six or eight pieces of cannon, which, with the
boats in our possession, I purpose to make an attack
on the armed sloop of George the Third which
is now cruising on Lake Champlain, and is about
twice as big as the schooner. I hope in a short
time to be authorized to acquaint your Honor that
Lake Champlain and the fortifications thereon are
subjected to the Colonies. The enterprise has
been approbated by the officers and soldiery of
the Green Mountain Boys, nor do I hesitate as to
the success. I expect lives must be lost in the
attack, as the commander of George's sloop is a
man of courage, etc. I conclude Capt. Warner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is by this time in possession of Crown Point, the

officers to Hartford. These gentlemen have been
very assiduous and active in the late expedition.

<p class="pfs70">ALLEN'S LETTERS TO THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS,
TO THE NEW YORK PROVINCIAL CONGRESS, AND
TO THE MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESS.</p>


<p>The Continental Congress, affected by sinister
influences, favored the removal of the
stores and cannon of Ticonderoga to the south
end of Lake George. Allen wrote to Congress
a vigorous remonstrance. Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, and Connecticut protested, and the
project was abandoned. On May 29th, 1775,
from Crown Point, Allen addressed the Continental
Congress as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An abstract of the action of Congress has just
come to hand: and though it approves of the taking
the fortress on Lake Champlain and the artillery,
etc., I am, nevertheless, much surprised that
your Honors should recommend it to us to remove
the artillery to the south end of Lake George, and
there to make a stand; the consequences of which
must ruin the frontier settlements, which are extended
at least one hundred miles to the northward
from that place. Probably your Honors were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
informed of those settlements, which consist of
several thousand families who are seated on that
tract of country called the New Hampshire Grants.
Those inhabitants, by making those valuable acquisitions
for the Colonies, have incensed Governor
Carleton and all the ministerial party in
Canada against them; and provided they should,
after all their good service in behalf of their country,
be neglected and left exposed, they will be of
all men the most consummately miserable....</p>

<p>If the King's troops be again in possession of
Ticonderoga and Crown Point and command the
Lake, the Indians and Canadians will be much more
inclined to join with them and make incursions
into the heart of our country. But the Colonies
are now in possession and actual command of the
Lake, having taken the armed sloop from George
the Third, which was cruising in the Lake, also
seized a schooner belonging to Major Skene at
South Bay, and have armed and manned them
both.... The Canadians (all except the noblesse)
and also the Indians appear at present to be very
friendly to us; and it is my humble opinion that
the more vigorous the Colonies push the war
against the King's troops in Canada, the more
friends we shall find in that country. Provided I
had but 500 men with me at St. John's (18th May)
when we took the King's sloop, I would have advanced
to Montreal. Nothing strengthens our
friends in Canada equal to our prosperity in taking
the sovereignty of Lake Champlain, and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Colonies forthwith send an army of two or
three thousand men and attack Montreal, we should
have little to fear from the Canadians or Indians,
and should easily make a conquest of that place,
and set up the standard of liberty in the extensive
province of Quebec, whose limit was enlarged
purely to subvert the liberties of America. Striking
such a blow would intimidate the Tory party
in Canada, the same as the commencement of the
war at Boston intimidated the Tories in the Colonies.
They are a set of gentlemen that will not be
converted by reason, but are easily wrought upon
by fear.</p>

<p>By a council of war held on board the sloop the
27th instant, it was agreed to advance to the Point
Aufere with the sloop and schooner, and a number
of armed boats well manned, and there make a
stand, act on the defensive, and by all means command
the Lake and defend the frontiers. Point
Aufere is about six miles this side of forty-five
degrees north latitude, but if the wisdom of the
Continental Congress should view the proposed
invasion of the King's troops in Canada as premature
or impolitic, nevertheless, I humbly conceive,
when your Honors come to the knowledge of the
before-mentioned facts, you will at least establish
some advantageous situation toward the northerly
part of Lake Champlain, as a frontier, instead of
the south promontory of Lake George. Commanding
the northerly part of the Lake, puts it in our
power to work our policy with the Canadians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Indians. We have made considerable proficiency
this way already. Sundry tribes have been to
visit us, and have returned to their tribes to use
their influence in our favor. We have just sent
Capt. Abraham Ninham, a Stockbridge Indian, as
our embassador of peace to the several tribes of
Indians in Canada. He was accompanied by Mr.
Winthrop Hoit, who has been a prisoner with the
Indians and understands their tongue. I do not
imagine, provided we command Lake Champlain,
there will be any need of a war with the Canadians
or Indians.</p></div>

<p>On June 2, 1775, Allen addressed the New
York Provincial Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pork forwarded to subsist the army, by your
Honors' direction, evinces your approbation of
the procedure; and as it was a private expedition,
and common fame reports that there are a number
of overgrown Tories in the province, your Honors
will the readier excuse me in not first taking your
advice in the matter, but the enterprises might
have been prevented by their treachery. It is
here reported that some of them have been lately
savingly converted, and that others have lost their
influence. If in those achievements there be anything
honorary, the subjects of your government,
viz., the New Hampshire settlers, are justly entitled
to a large share, as they had a great majority
of numbers of the soldiery as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
command in making those acquisitions, and as
your Honors justify and approve the same.</p>

<p>I desire and expect your Honors have, or soon
will lay before the Grand Continental Congress,
the great disadvantage it must inevitably be to
the Colonies to evacuate Lake Champlain, and
give up to the enemies of our country those invaluable
acquisitions, the key of either Canada or our
country, according as which party holds the same
in possession and makes a proper improvement of
it. The key is ours as yet, and provided the
Colonies would suddenly push an army of two or
three thousand men into Canada, they might make
a conquest of all that would oppose them in the
extensive province of Quebec, except a reinforcement
from England should prevent it. Such a
diversion would weaken General Gage or insure
us of Canada.</p>

<p>I wish to God America would at this critical
juncture exert herself agreeable to the indignity
offered her by a tyrannical ministry. She might
rise on eagle's wings, and mount up to glory, freedom,
and immortal honor if she did but know and
exert her strength. Fame is now hovering over
her head. A vast continent must now sink to
slavery, poverty, horror, and bondage, or rise to
unconquerable freedom, immense wealth, inexpressible
felicity, and immortal fame.</p>

<p>I will lay my life on it, with fifteen hundred
men and a proper train of artillery I will take
Montreal. Provided I could be thus furnished and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
if an army could command the field, it would be
no insuperable difficulty to take Quebec. This
object should be pursued, though it should take
ten thousand men to accomplish the end proposed;
for England cannot spare but a certain number of
her troops, anyway, she has but a small number
that are disciplined [this was months before the
Hessians and other mercenaries were hired], and
it is as long as it is broad the more that are sent to
Quebec, the less they can send to Boston, or any
other part of the continent.</p>

<p>Our friends in Canada can never help us until
we first help them, except in a passive or inactive
manner. There are now about seven hundred
regular troops in Canada. I have lately had
sundry conferences with the Indians; they are
very friendly. Capt. Abraham Ninham, a Stockbridge
Indian, and Mr. Winthrop Hoit, who has
sundry years lived with the Caughnawgoes in the
capacity of a prisoner and was made an adopted
son to a motherly squaw of that tribe, have both
been gone ten days to treat with the Indians as
our embassadors of peace and friendship. I expect
in a few weeks to hear from them. By them
I sent a friendly letter to the Indians which Mr.
Hoit can explain to them in Indian. The thing
that so unites the Indians to us is our taking the
sovereignty of Lake Champlain. They have wit
enough to make a good bargain, and stand by the
strongest side. Much the same may be said of
the Canadians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be thought that to push an army into
Canada would be too premature and imprudent.
If so, I propose to make a stand at the Isle-aux-Noix
which the French fortified by intrenchment
the last war, and greatly fatigued our large army
to take it. It is about fifteen miles this side St.
John's. Our only having it in our power thus to
make incursions into Canada, might probably be
the very reason why it would be unnecessary to
do so, even if the Canadians should prove more
refractory than I think for.</p>

<p>Lastly, with submission I would propose to your
Honors to raise a small regiment of Rangers,
which I could easily do, and that mostly in the
counties of Albany and Charlotte, provided your
Honors should think it expedient to grant commissions
and thus regulate and put the same under
pay. Probably your Honors may think this an
impertinent proposal: it is truly the first favor I
ever asked of the Government, and if it be granted,
I shall be zealously ambitious to conduct for the
best good of my country and the honor of the
Government.</p></div>

<p>On June 9th Allen addressed the Massachusetts
Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These armed vessels are at present abundantly
sufficient to command the Lake. The making
these acquisitions has greatly attached the Canadians,
and more especially the Indians, to our
interest. They have no personal prejudice or con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>troversy
with the United Colonies, but act upon
political principles, and consequently are inclined
to fall in with the strongest side. At present ours
has the appearance of it; as there are at present
but seven hundred regular troops in all the different
parts of Canada. Add to this the consideration
of the imperious and haughty conduct of the troops,
which has much alienated the affections of both
the Canadians and Indians from them. Probably
there may soon be more troops from England sent
there, but at present you may rely on it that
Canada is in a weak and helpless condition. Two
or three thousand men, conducted by intrepid commanders,
would at this juncture make a conquest
of the ministerial party in Canada with such additional
numbers as may be supposed to vie with
the reinforcements that may be sent from England.
Such a plan would make a diversion in
favor of the Massachusetts Bay, who have been too
much burdened with the calamity that should be
more general, as all partake of the salutary effects
of their valor and merit in the defence of the liberties
of America. I hope, gentlemen, you will use
your influence in forwarding men, provisions, and
every article for the army that may be thought
necessary. Blankets, provisions, and powder are

<p class="pfs70">ALLEN'S LETTERS TO THE MONTREAL MERCHANTS,
TO THE INDIANS IN CANADA, AND TO THE
CANADIANS.&mdash;JOHN BROWN.</p>


<p>The letters to the Indians and Canadians
to which Allen has referred show still more
clearly the vigorous policy and the adroitness
which Allen displayed in the preparations for
the invasion of Canada. He wrote to the Montreal
merchants:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. John's</span>, May 18th.</p>

<p class="negin1"><em>To Mr. James Morrison and the Merchants that are
friendly to the Cause of Liberty in Montreal.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have the pleasure to acquaint
you that Lakes George and Champlain, with the
fortresses, artillery, etc., particularly the armed
sloop of George the Third, with all water carriages
of these lakes, are now in possession of the Colonies.
I expect the English merchants, as well as all
virtuous disposed gentlemen, will be in the interest
of the Colonies. The advanced guard of the army
is now at St. John's, and desire immediately to
have a personal intercourse with you. Your im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>mediate
assistance as to provisions, ammunition,
and spirituous liquors is wanted and forthwith expected,
not as a donation, for I am empowered by
the Colonies to purchase the same; and I desire
you would forthwith and without further notice
prepare for the use of the army those articles to
the amount of five hundred pounds, and deliver
the same to me at St. John's, or at least a part of it
almost instantaneously, as the soldiers press on
faster than provisions.</p>

<p>I need not inform you that my directions from
the Colonies are, not to contend with or any way
injure or molest the Canadians or Indians; but, on
the other hand, treat them with the greatest
friendship and kindness. You will be pleased to
communicate the same to them, and some of you
immediately visit me at this place, while others
are active in delivering the provisions.</p></div>

<p>On May 24, 1775, Allen addressed a letter
to the Indians of Canada:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Headquarters of the Army, Crown Point.</span></p>

<p>By advice of council of the officers, I recommend
our trusty and well-beloved friend and brother,
Capt. Abraham Ninham of Stockbridge, as our embassador
of peace to our good brother Indians of
the four tribes, viz., the Hocnaurigoes, the Surgaches,
the Canesadaugaus and the Saint Fransawas.</p>

<p>Loving brothers and friends, I have to inform
you that George the Third, King of England, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
made war with the English Colonies in America,
who have ever until now been his good subjects,
and sent his army and killed some of your good
friends and brothers at Boston, in the Province of
the Massachusetts Bay. Then your good brothers
in that Province, and in all the Colonies of English
America, made war with King George and
have begun to kill the men of his army, and have
taken Ticonderoga and Crown Point from him, and
all the artillery, and also a great sloop which was
at St. Johns, and all the boats in the lake, and
have raised and are raising two great armies; one
is destined for Boston, and the other for the fortresses
and department of Lake Champlain, to
fight the King's troops that oppose the Colonies
from Canada; and as King George's soldiers killed
our brothers and friends in a time of peace, I hope,
as Indians are good and honest men, you will not
fight for King George against your friends in
America, as they have done you no wrong, and
desire to live with you as brothers. You know it
is good for my warriors and Indians too, to kill the
Regulars, because they first began to kill our
brothers in this country without cause.</p>

<p>I was always a friend to Indians and have
hunted with them many times, and know how to
shoot and ambush like Indians, and am a great
hunter. I want to have your warriors come and
see me, and help me fight the King's Regular
troops. You know they stand all along close together
rank and file, and my men fight so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Indians do, and I want your warriors to join with
me and my warriors like brothers and ambush the
Regulars: if you will I will give you money,
blankets, tomahawks, knives, paint, and anything
there is in the army, just like brothers; and I will
go with you into the woods to scout, and my men
and your men will sleep together and eat and drink
together, and fight Regulars because they first
killed our brothers and will fight against us;
therefore I want our brother Indians to help us
fight, for I know Indians are good warriors and
can fight well in the bush.</p>

<p>Ye know my warriors must fight, but if you, our
brother Indians, do not fight on either side, we
will still be friends and brothers; and you may
come and hunt in our woods, and come with your
canoes in the lake, and let us have venison at our
forts on the lake, and have rum, bread, and what
you want, and be like brothers. I have sent our
friend Winthrop Hoit to treat with you on our behalf
in friendship. You know him, for he has
lived with you, and is your adopted son, and is a
good man; Captain Ninham of Stockbridge and
he will tell you about the whole matter more than
I can write. I hope your warriors will come and
see me. So I bid all my brother Indians farewell.</p>

<p class="right padr4">
<span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>,</p>

<p class="right"><em>Colonel of the Green Mountain Boys</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>Two days after the date of this letter Allen
sent a copy of it to the Assembly of Connecti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>cut,
saying: "I thought it advisable that the
Honorable Assembly should be informed of all
our politicks."</p>

<p>Allen shows great shrewdness in adapting
his letters to what he considers the aboriginal
mind. Addressing the Indians constantly as
brothers he appeals to their love of bush-fighting,
and as regards the question of barter, to
their love of rum. By his reiteration he recognizes
the childish immaturity of the Indian.
Far differently he addresses the Canadians, to
whose reason he appeals and whose sense of
justice he compliments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ticonderoga</span>, June 4.</p>

<p class="negin1"><em>Countrymen and Friends, the French people of Canada,
greeting</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friends and Fellow-Countrymen</span>:&mdash;You are
undoubtedly more or less acquainted with the
unnatural and unhappy controversy subsisting
between Great Britain and her Colonies, the
particulars of which in this letter we do not expatiate
upon, but refer your considerations of the
justice and equitableness thereof on the part of
the Colonies, to the former knowledge that you
have of this matter. We need only observe that
the inhabitants of the Colonies view the controversy
on their part to be justifiable in the sight
of God, and all unprejudiced and honest men that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
have or may have opportunity and ability to examine
into the merits of it. Upon this principle
those inhabitants determine to vindicate their
cause, and maintain their natural and constitutional
rights and liberties at the expense of their
lives and fortunes, but have not the least disposition
to injure, molest, or in any way deprive our
fellow-subjects, the Canadians, of their liberty or
property. Nor have they any design to urge war
against them; and from all intimations that the
inhabitants of the said Colonies have received
from the Canadians, it has appeared that they
were alike disposed for friendship and neutrality,
and not at all disposed to take part with the King's
troops in the present civil war against the Colonies.</p>

<p>We were, nevertheless, surprised to hear that a
number of about thirty Canadians attacked our
reconnoitring party consisting of four men, fired
on them, and pursued them, and obliged them to
return the fire. This is the account of the party
that has since arrived at headquarters. We
desire to know of any gentlemen Canadians the
facts of the case, as one story is good until another
is told. Our general order to the soldiery was,
that they should not, on pain of death, molest or
kill any of your people. But if it shall appear,
upon examination, that our reconnoitring party
commenced hostilities against your people, they
shall suffer agreeable to the sentence of a court-martial;
for our special orders from the Colonies
are to befriend and protect you if need be; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
if you desire their friendship you are invited to
embrace it, for nothing can be more undesirable
to your friends in the Colonies, than a war with
their fellow-subjects the Canadians, or with the
Indians.</p>

<p>Hostilities have already begun; to fight with
the King's troops has become a necessary and incumbent
duty; the Colonies cannot avoid it. But
pray, is it necessary that the Canadians and the
inhabitants of the English Colonies should butcher
one another? God forbid! There is no controversy
subsisting between you and them. Pray let
old England and the Colonies fight it out, and you,
Canadians, stand by and see what an arm of flesh
can do. We conclude, Saint Luke, Captain McCoy,
and other evil-minded persons whose interest
and inclination is that the Canadians and the people
of these Colonies should cut one another's
throats, have inveigled some of the baser sort of
your people to attack our said reconnoitring party.</p></div>

<p>Allen signed this letter as "At present the
Principal Commander of the Army."</p>

<p>A copy of it was sent to Mr. Walker at Montreal
by Mr. Jeffere. Another copy was sent
to the New York Provincial Congress.</p>

<p>John Brown, a young lawyer of Pittsfield,
Massachusetts, was the cause of Ethan Allen's
long, terrible captivity. That alone justifies
our curiosity to know all about him. In March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
before the war, he made an eventful trip to
Montreal, going along our borders, crossing
the lakes, visiting Bennington, engaging two
pilots, contracting with the foremost men
there, spending days investigating the status
of affairs in Canada as to the coming struggle.
Reporting to his employers, Samuel Adams
and Dr. Joseph Warren, he says that after
stopping about a fortnight at Albany he was
fourteen days journeying to St. John's, undergoing
inconceivable hardships; the lake very
high, the country for twenty miles each
side under water; the ice breaking loose for
miles; two days frozen in to an island; "we
were glad to foot it on land;" "there is no
prospect of Canada sending delegates to the
Continental Congress." He speaks of his
pilot, Peleg Sunderland, as "an old Indian
hunter acquainted with the St. Francis Indians
and their language." The other pilot was a
captive many years ago among the Caughnawaga
Indians. This last was Winthrop Hoit, of
Bennington. These two men were famous for
their familiarity with Indian ways and speech,
as well as for general prowess, and their exploits
in "beech-sealing" the Yorkers. Several
days Sunderland and Hoit were among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Caughnawagas, studying their manifestations
of feeling toward the colonists. Brown gave
letters to Thomas Walker and Blake, and
pamphlets to four curés in La Prairie. He
was kindly received by the local committee,
who told him about Canadian politics, that
Governor Carleton was no great politician, a
man of sour, morose temper, and so forth.
Brown wrote Adams and Warren he should
not go to Quebec, "as a number of their committee
are here," but "I shall tarry here some
time." "I have established a channel of
correspondence through the New Hampshire
Grants which may be depended on." "One
thing I must mention, to be kept as a profound
secret. The fort at Ticonderoga must be
seized as soon as possible should hostilities be
committed by the King's troops. <em>The people
on New Hampshire Grants have engaged to do
this business.</em>" This letter was dated three
weeks before the Lexington and Concord fights
electrified the continent.</p>

<p class="pfs70">WARNER ELECTED COLONEL OF THE GREEN MOUNTAIN
BOYS.&mdash;ALLEN'S LETTER TO GOVERNOR
TRUMBULL.&mdash;CORRESPONDENCE IN REGARD TO
THE INVASION OF CANADA.&mdash;ATTACK ON MONTREAL.&mdash;DEFEAT
AND CAPTURE.&mdash;WARNER'S REPORT.</p>


<p>On July 27th committees of towns met at
Dorset to choose a lieutenant-colonel of the
regiment, and thus of those Green Mountain
Boys for whose organization Allen had been
so active and efficient with both the Continental
and New York Congresses. Seth Warner
received forty-one of the forty-six votes cast.
Deep was Allen's chagrin and mortification,
as appears in the following letter to Governor
Trumbull:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ticonderoga</span>, August 3, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honored Sir</span>:&mdash;General Schuyler exerts his
utmost in building boats and making preparations
for the army to advance, as I suppose, to St.
John's, etc. We have an insufficient store of provisions
for such an undertaking, though the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>jection
is now universally approved. Provisions
are hurrying forward, but not so fast as I could
hope for. General Wooster's corps has not arrived.
I fear there is some treachery among the
New York Tory party relative to forwarding the
expedition, though I am confident that the General
is faithful. No troops from New York, except some
officers, have arrived, though it is given out that
they will soon be here. The General tells me
he does not want any more troops till more provisions
come to hand, which he is hurrying; and
ordered the troops under General Wooster, part
to be billeted in the mean while at Albany and
part to mend the road from there to Lake George.</p>

<p>It is indeed an arduous work to furnish an army
to prosecute an enterprise. In the interim, I am
apprehensive, the enemy are forming one against
us; witness the sailing of the transports and two
men of war from Boston, as it is supposed for
Quebeck. Probably, it appears that the King's
Troops are discouraged of making incursions into
the Province of the Massachusetts Bay. Likely
they will send part of their force to overawe the
Canadians, and inveigle the Indians into their
interest. I fear the Colonies have been too slow
in their resolutions and preparations relative to
this department; but hope they may still succeed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my zeal and success in my
country's cause, the old farmers on the New Hampshire
Grants (who do not incline to go to war)
have met in a committee meeting, and in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
nomination of officers for the regiment of Green
Mountain Boys (who are quickly to be raised)
have wholly omitted me; but as the commissions
will come from the Continental Congress, I hope
they will remember me, as I desire to remain in
the service, and remain your Honor's most obedient
and humble servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>.</p>

<p class="negin2 small">To the Hon. Jona. Trumbull, Governor of the Colony of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;General Schuyler will transmit to your
Honors a copy of the affidavits of two intelligent
friends, who have just arrived from Canada. I
apprehend that what they have delivered is truth.
I find myself in the favor of the officers of the
Army and the young Green Mountain Boys. How
the old men came to reject me I cannot conceive,
inasmuch as I saved them from the encroachments
of New York.</p>

<p class="right">E. A.</p>
</div>

<p>This Jonathan Trumbull, be it remembered,
was the original "Brother Jonathan."</p>

<p>Allen's first connection with the campaign
in Canada is explained in his own narrative:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Early in the fall of the year, the little army
under the command of the Generals Schuyler and
Montgomery were ordered to advance into Canada.
I was at Ticonderoga when this order arrived;
and the General, with most of the field
officers, requested me to attend them in the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>pedition;
and though at that time I had no commission
from Congress, yet they engaged me, that
I should be considered as an officer, the same as
though I had a commission; and should, as occasion
might require, command certain detachments
of the army. This I considered as an honorable
offer, and did not hesitate to comply with it.</p></div>

<p>September 8, 1775, from St. Therese, James
Livingston wrote to General Schuyler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your manifestos came to hand, and despatched
them off to the different Parishes with all possible
care and expedition. The Canadians are all
friends, and a spirit of freedom seems to reign
amongst them. Colonel Allen, Major Brown and
myself set off this morning with a party of Canadians
with intention to go to your army; but hearing
of a party of Indians waiting for us the same
side of the river, we thought it most prudent to
retire in order, if possible, to raise a more considerable
party of men. We shall drop down the
River Chambly, as far as my house, where a
number of Canadians are waiting for us.</p></div>

<p>September 10, 1775, at Isle-aux-Noix, General
Schuyler in his orders to Colonel Ritzemd,
who was going into Canada with five hundred
men, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Colonel Allen and Major Brown have orders to
request that provisions may be brought to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which must be punctually paid for, for which
purpose I have furnished you with the sum of
£318 1s. 10d. in gold.</p></div>

<p>September 15, 1775, at Isle-aux-Noix, General
Schuyler received from James Livingston
a report in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday morning, I sent a party each side of
the river, Colonel Allen at their head, to take the
vessels at Sorel, by surprise if possible. Numbers
of people flock to them, and make no doubt they
will carry their point. I have cut off the communication
from Montreal to Chambly. We have
nothing to fear here at present but a few seigneurs
in the country endeavoring to raise forces.
I hope Colonel Allen's presence will put a stop
to it.</p></div>

<p>September 8, 1775, at Isle-aux-Noix, Schuyler
writes Hancock:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I hope to hear in a day or two from Colonel
Allen and Major Brown, who went to deliver my
declaration.</p></div>

<p>This refers to Schuyler's address to the inhabitants
of Canada, dated Isle-aux-Noix, September 5,
1775.</p>

<p>From Isle-aux-Noix, September 14, 1775,
Ethan Allen reports to General Schuyler:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Set out from Isle-aux-Noix on the 8th instant;
arrived at Chambly; found the Canadians in that
vicinity friendly. They guarded me under arms
night and day, escorted me through the woods
as I desired, and showed me every courtesy I
could wish for. The news of my being in this
place excited many captains of the Militia and
respectable gentlemen of the Canadians to visit
and converse with me, as I gave out I was sent by
General Schuyler to manifest his friendly intentions
toward them, and delivered the General's
written manifesto to them to the same purpose.
I likewise sent a messenger to the chiefs of the
Caughnawaga Indians, demanding the cause why
sundry of the Indians had taken up arms against
the United Colonies; they had sent two of their
chiefs to me, who plead that it was contrary to the
will and orders of their chiefs. The King's troops
gave them rum and inveigled them to fight against
General Schuyler; that they had sent their runners
and ordered them to depart from St. John's,
averring their friendship to the Colonies. Meanwhile
the Sachems held a General Council, sent
two of their Captains and some beads and a wampum
belt as a lasting testimony of their friendship,
and that they would not take up arms on either
side. These tokens of friendship were delivered
to me, agreeable to their ceremony, in a solemn
manner, in the presence of a large auditory of
Canadians, who approved of the league and manifested
friendship to the Colonies, and testified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
their good-will on account of the advance of the
army into Canada. Their fears (as they said)
were, that our army was too weak to protect them
against the severity of the English Government,
as a defeat on our part would expose our friends
in Canada to it. In this dilemma our friends
expressed anxiety of mind. It furthermore appeared
to me that many of the Canadians were
watching the scale of power, whose attraction
attracted them. In fine, our friends in Canada
earnestly urged that General Schuyler should immediately
environ St. John's, and that they would
assist in cutting off the communication between
St. John's and Chambly, and between these forts
and Montreal. They furthermore assured me that
they would help our army to provisions, etc., and
that if our army did not make a conquest of the
King's garrisons, they would be exposed to the
resentment of the English Government, which
they dreaded, and consequently the attempt of
the army into Canada would be to them the greatest
evil. They further told me that some of the
inhabitants, that were in their hearts friendly to
us, would, to extricate themselves, take up arms
in favor of the Crown; and therefore, that it was
of the last importance to them, as well as to us,
that the army immediately attack St. John's;
which would cause them to take up arms in our
favor. Governor Carleton threatens the Canadians
with fire and sword, except they assist him against
the Colonies, and the seigneurs urge them to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
They have withstood Carleton and them, and keep
under arms throughout most of their Parishes, and
are now anxiously watching the scale of power.
This is the situation of affairs in Canada, according
to my most painful discovery. Given under
my hand, upon honor, this 14th day of September,
1775.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen.</span></p>

<p class="negin2 small">To his Excellency General Schuyler.</p>
</div>

<p>With one more letter from Allen (to General
Montgomery) we will close his correspondence
on the invasion of Canada, which he so strongly
urged, so shrewdly planned, and yet which
failed from lack of the co-operation of others:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">St. Tours</span>, September 20, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Excellent Sir</span>:&mdash;I am now in the Parish of St.
Tours, four leagues to the south; have two hundred
and fifty Canadians under arms; as I march
they gather fast. These are the objects of taking
the vessels in Sorel and General Carleton. These
objects I pass by to assist the army besieging St.
John's. If this place be taken the country is ours;
if we miscarry in this, all other achievements will
profit but little. I am fearful our army may be
too sickly, and that the siege may be hard; therefore
choose to assist in conquering St. John's,
which, of consequence, conquers the whole. You
may rely on it that I shall join you in about three
days, with three hundred or more Canadian volunteers.
I could raise one or two thousand in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
week's time, but will first visit the army with a
less number, and if necessary will go again recruiting.
Those that used to be enemies to our
cause come cap in hand to me, and I swear by the
Lord I can raise three times the number of our
army in Canada, provided you continue the siege;
all depends on that. It is the advice of the officers
with me, that I speedily repair to the army.
God grant you wisdom, fortitude and every accomplishment
of a victorious general; the eyes
of all America, nay, of Europe, are or will be on
the economy of this army, and the consequences
attending it. I am your most obedient humble
servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have purchased six hogsheads of rum,
and sent a sergeant with a small party to deliver
it at headquarters. Mr. Livingston, and others
under him, will provide what fresh beef you need;
as to bread and flour, I am forwarding what I can.
You may rely on my utmost attention to this object,
as well as raising auxiliaries. I know the
ground is swampy and bad for raising batteries,
but pray let no object of obstructions be insurmountable.
The glory of a victory, which will be
attended with such important consequences, will
crown all our fatigue, risks, and labors; to fail of
victory will be an eternal disgrace; but to obtain
it will elevate us on the wings of fame.</p>

<p class="right padr6">Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>On September 17th, three and a half months
after Allen urged the invasion of Canada,
Montgomery began the siege of St. John's.
Two or three days later Warner arrived with
his regiment of Green Mountain Boys. Arnold,
not behind in energy and daring, captured
a British sloop.</p>

<p>On September 24th Allen, with about eighty
men, chiefly Canadians, met Major John Brown,
with about two hundred Americans and Canadians,
and Brown proposed to attack Montreal.
It was agreed that Brown should cross the St.
Lawrence that night above the city, while Allen
crossed it below. Allen added about thirty
English-Americans to his force and crossed.
The cause of Brown's failure to meet him has
never been explained. Several hundred English-Canadians
and Indians with forty regular
soldiers attacked Allen, and for two hours he
bravely and skilfully fought a force several
times larger than his own. Most of Allen's
Canadian allies deserted him, and with thirty
of his men he was finally captured, loaded with
irons, and transported to England.</p>

<p>Thus, within five months, Allen, who had
never before seen a battle or an army, who
had never been trained as a soldier, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">La Prairie</span>, September 27, 1775.</p>

<p>May it please your Honor, I have the disagreeable
news to write you that Colonel Allen hath
met a defeat by a stronger force which sallied out
of the town of Montreal after he had crossed the
river about a mile below the town. I have no
certain knowledge as yet whether he is killed,
taken, or fled; but his defeat hath put the French
people into great consternation. They are much
concerned for fear of a company coming over
against us. Furthermore the Indian chiefs were
at Montreal at the time of Allen's battle, and
there were a number of Caughnawaga Indians in
the battle against Allen, and the people are very
fearful of the Indians. There were six in here
last night, I suppose sent as spies. I asked the
Indians concerning their appearing against us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
every battle; their answer to me was, that Carleton
made them drunk and drove them to it; but they
said they would do so no more. I should think it
proper to keep a party at Longueil, and my party
is not big enough to divide. If I must tarry here,
I should be glad of my regiment, for my party is
made up with different companies in different
regiments, and my regulation is not as good as I
could wish, for subordination to your orders is my
pleasure. I am, sir, with submission, your humble
servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Seth Warner</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent mmx1 small">To General Montgomery.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This moment arrived from Colonel Allen's defeat,
Captain Duggan with the following intelligence:
Colonel Allen is absolutely taken captive
to Montreal with a few more, and about two
or three killed, and about as many wounded.
The living are not all come in. Something of a
slaughter made among the King's troops. From
yours to serve,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Seth Warner</span>.</p>

<p>Schuyler, Montgomery, and Livingston, in
letters written after the defeat, comment on
Allen's imprudence in making the attack single-handed,
but no mention is made of Brown,
with whose force Allen expected to be re-enforced,
and with whose help the tide of battle
might have been turned and Canada's future
might have been entirely changed.</p>

AND SURRENDER.&mdash;BRUTAL TREATMENT.&mdash;ARRIVAL
IN ENGLAND.&mdash;DEBATES IN
PARLIAMENT.</p>


<p>The story of Allen's captivity is best told in
his own vivid narrative as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the morning of the 24th day of September
I set out with my guard of about eighty men,
from Longueuil, to go to Laprairie, from whence
I determined to go to General Montgomery's
camp; I had not advanced two miles before I met
with Major Brown, who has since been advanced
to the rank of a colonel, who desired me to halt,
saying that he had something of importance to
communicate to me and my confidants; upon which
I halted the party and went into a house, and took
a private room with him and several of my associates,
where Colonel Brown proposed that, provided
I would return to Longueuil and procure
some canoes, so as to cross the river St. Lawrence
a little north of Montreal, he would cross it a little
to the south of the town, with near two hundred
men, as he had boats sufficient, and that we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
make ourselves masters of Montreal. This plan
was readily approved by me and those in council,
and in consequence of which I returned to Longueuil,
collected a few canoes, and added about
thirty English-Americans to my party and crossed
the river in the night of the 24th, agreeably to the
proposed plan.</p>

<p>My whole party at this time consisted of about
one hundred and ten men, near eighty of whom
were Canadians. We were most of the night
crossing the river, as we had so few canoes that
they had to pass and repass three times to carry
my party across. Soon after daybreak, I set a
guard between me and the town, with special orders
to let no person pass or repass them, another
guard on the other end of the road with like directions;
in the mean time, I reconnoitred the
best ground to make a defence, expecting Colonel
Brown's party was landed on the other side of the
town, he having the day before agreed to give
three huzzas with his men early in the morning,
which signal I was to return, that we might each
know that both parties were landed; but the sun
by this time being nearly two hours high, and the
sign failing, I began to conclude myself to be in
a præmunire, and would have crossed the river
back again, but I knew the enemy would have discovered
such an attempt; and as there could not
more than one-third part of my troops cross at
a time, the other two-thirds would of course fall
into their hands. This I could not reconcile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
my own feelings as a man, much less as an officer;
I therefore concluded to maintain the ground
if possible and all to fare alike. In consequence
of this resolution, I dispatched two messengers,
one to Laprairie to Colonel Brown, and the other
to L'Assomption, a French settlement, to Mr.
Walker who was in our interest, requesting their
speedy assistance, giving them at the same time
to understand my critical situation. In the mean
time, sundry persons came to my guards pretending
to be friends, but were by them taken prisoners
and brought to me. These I ordered to confinement
until their friendship could be further confirmed;
for I was jealous they were spies, as they
proved to be afterward. One of the principal of
them making his escape, exposed the weakness of
my party, which was the final cause of my misfortune;
for I have been since informed that Mr.
Walker, agreeably to my desire, exerted himself,
and had raised a considerable number of men for
my assistance, which brought him into difficulty
afterward, but upon hearing of my misfortune he
disbanded them again.</p>

<p>The town of Montreal was in a great tumult.
General Carleton and the royal party made every
preparation to go on board their vessels of force,
as I was afterward informed, but the spy escaped
from my guard to the town occasioned an alteration
in their policy and emboldened General
Carleton to send the force which had there collected
out against me. I had previously chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
my ground, but when I saw the number of the
enemy as they sallied out of the town I perceived
it would be a day of trouble, if not of rebuke; but
I had no chance to flee, as Montreal was situated
on an island and the St. Lawrence cut off my communication
to General Montgomery's camp. I
encouraged my soldiers to bravely defend themselves,
that we should soon have help, and that
we should be able to keep the ground if no
more. This and much more I affirmed with the
greatest seeming assurance, and which in reality
I thought to be in some degree probable.</p>

<p>The enemy consisted of not more than forty
regular troops, together with a mixed multitude,
chiefly Canadians, with a number of English who
lived in town, and some Indians; in all to the
number of five hundred.</p>

<p>The reader will notice that most of my party
were Canadians; indeed, it was a motley parcel of
soldiery which composed both parties. However,
the enemy began to attack from wood-piles, ditches,
buildings, and such like places, at a considerable
distance, and I returned the fire from a situation
more than equally advantageous. The attack began
between two and three o'clock in the afternoon,
just before which I ordered a volunteer by
the name of Richard Young, with a detachment
of nine men as a flank guard, which, under the
cover of the bank of the river, could not only annoy
the enemy, but at the same time serve as a flank
guard to the left of the main body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire continued for some time on both sides;
and I was confident that such a remote method of
attack could not carry the ground, provided it
should be continued till night; but near half the
body of the enemy began to flank round to my
right, upon which I ordered a volunteer by the
name of John Dugan, who had lived many years
in Canada and understood the French language, to
detach about fifty Canadians, and post himself at
an advantageous ditch which was on my right,
to prevent my being surrounded. He advanced
with the detachment, but instead of occupying
the post made his escape, as did likewise Mr.
Young upon the left, with their detachments. I
soon perceived that the enemy was in possession
of the ground which Dugan should have occupied.
At this time I had but about forty-five men with
me, some of whom were wounded; the enemy
kept closing round me, nor was it in my power
to prevent it; by which means my situation, which
was advantageous in the first part of the attack,
ceased to be so in the last; and being entirely
surrounded with such vast, unequal numbers, I
ordered a retreat, but found that those of the enemy
who were of the country, and their Indians,
could run as fast as my men, though the regulars
could not. Thus I retreated near a mile, and
some of the enemy with the savages kept flanking
me, and others crowded hard in the rear. In fine,
I expected in a very short time to try the world
of spirits; for I was apprehensive that no quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would be given to me, and therefore had determined
to sell my life as dear as I could. One of
the enemy's officers boldly pressing in the rear,
discharged his fusee at me; the ball whistled near
me, as did many others that day. I returned the
salute and missed him, as running had put us both
out of breath; for I concluded we were not frightened.
I then saluted him with my tongue in a
harsh manner, and told him that inasmuch as his
numbers were so far superior to mine, I would
surrender provided I could be treated with honor
and be assured of a good quarter for myself and
the men who were with me; and he answered I
should; another officer, coming up directly after,
confirmed the treaty; upon which I agreed to
surrender with my party, which then consisted of
thirty-one effective men and seven wounded. I
ordered them to ground their arms, which they did.</p>

<p>The officer I capitulated with then directed me
and my party to advance toward him, which was
done; I handed him my sword, and in half a minute
after a savage, part of whose head was shaved,
being almost naked and painted, with feathers
intermixed with the hair of the other side of his
head, came running to me with an incredible
swiftness; he seemed to advance with more than
mortal speed; as he approached near me, his hellish
visage was beyond all description; snakes' eyes
appear innocent in comparison to his; his features
distorted, malice, death, murder, and the
wrath of devils and damned spirits are the em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>blems
of his countenance, and in less than twelve
feet of me, presented his firelock; at the instant
of his present, I twitched the officer to whom I
gave my sword between me and the savage; but
he flew round with great fury, trying to single
me out to shoot me without killing the officer,
but by this time I was nearly as nimble as he,
keeping the officer in such a position that his danger
was my defence; but in less than half a minute,
I was attacked by just such another imp of
hell. Then I made the officer fly around with
incredible velocity for a few seconds of time, when
I perceived a Canadian who had lost one eye, as
appeared afterward, taking my part against the
savages; and in an instant an Irishman came to
my assistance with a fixed bayonet, and drove away
the fiends, swearing by &mdash;&mdash; he would kill them.
This tragic scene composed my mind. The escaping
from so awful a death made even imprisonment
happy; the more so as my conquerors on the
field treated me with great civility and politeness.</p>

<p>The regular officers said that they were very
happy to see Colonel Allen. I answered them
that I should rather choose to have seen them at
General Montgomery's camp. The gentlemen
replied that they gave full credit to what I said,
and as I walked to the town, which was, as I
should guess, more than two miles, a British officer
walking at my right hand and one of the
French noblesse at my left; the latter of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in the action, had his eyebrow carried away by a
glancing shot, but was nevertheless very merry
and facetious, and no abuse was offered me till I
came to the barrack yard at Montreal, where I
met General Prescott, who asked me my name,
which I told him; he then asked me whether I
was that Colonel Allen who took Ticonderoga.
I told him that I was the very man; then he shook
his cane over my head, calling me many hard
names, among which he frequently used the word
rebel, and put himself in a great rage. I told
him he would do well not to cane me, for I was
not accustomed to it, and shook my fist at him,
telling him that was the beetle of mortality for
him if he offered to strike; upon which Captain
M'Cloud of the British, pulled him by the skirt
and whispered to him, as he afterward told me, to
this import, that it was inconsistent with his honor
to strike a prisoner. He then ordered a sergeant's
command with fixed bayonets to come forward and
kill thirteen Canadians who were included in the
treaty aforesaid.</p>

<p>It cut me to the heart to see the Canadians in so
hard a case, in consequence of their having been
true to me; they were wringing their hands, saying
their prayers, as I concluded, and expected
immediate death. I therefore stepped between
the executioners and the Canadians, opened my
clothes, and told General Prescott to thrust his
bayonet into my breast, for I was the sole cause
of the Canadians taking up arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The guard in the mean time, rolling their eyeballs
from the General to me, as though impatiently
waiting his dread command to sheath their
bayonets in my heart; I could however, plainly
discern, that he was in a suspense and quandary
about the matter; this gave me additional hopes
of succeeding; for my design was not to die, but
to save the Canadians by a finesse. The general
stood a minute, when he made the following reply:
"I will not execute you now, but you shall grace
a halter at Tyburn, &mdash;&mdash; you."</p>

<p>I remember I disdained his mentioning such a
place; I was, notwithstanding, a little pleased with
the expression, as it significantly conveyed to me
the idea of postponing the present appearance of
death; besides, his sentence was by no means final
as to "gracing a halter," although I had anxiety
about it after I landed in England, as the reader
will find in the course of this history. General
Prescott then ordered one of his officers to take
me on board the <i>Gaspee</i> schooner of war and confine
me, hands and feet, in irons, which was done
the same afternoon I was taken.</p>

<p>The action continued an hour and three-quarters
by the watch, and I know not to this day how
many of my men were killed, though I am certain
there were but few. If I remember right, seven
were wounded; one of them, Wm. Stewart by
name, was wounded by a savage with a tomahawk
after he was taken prisoner and disarmed, but
was rescued by some of the generous enemy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
so far recovered of his wounds that he afterward
went with the other prisoners to England.</p>

<p>Of the enemy, were killed a Major Carden, who
had been wounded in eleven different battles, and
an eminent merchant, Patterson, of Montreal, and
some others, but I never knew their whole loss,
as their accounts were different. I am apprehensive
that it is rare that so much ammunition was
expended and so little execution done by it; though
such of my party as stood the ground, behaved
with great fortitude&mdash;much exceeding that of the
enemy&mdash;but were not the best of marksmen, and,
I am apprehensive, were all killed or taken; the
wounded were all put into the hospital at Montreal,
and those that were not were put on board
of different vessels in the river and shackled together
by pairs, viz., two men fastened together
by one handcuff being closely fixed to one wrist
of each of them, and treated with the greatest severity,
nay, as criminals.</p>

<p>I now come to the description of the irons which
were put on me. The handcuff was of common
size and form, but my leg irons I should imagine
would weigh thirty pounds; the bar was eight feet
long and very substantial; the shackles which encompassed
my ankles were very tight. I was told
by the officer who put them on that it was the
king's plate, and I heard other of their officers
say that it would weigh forty weight. The irons
were so close upon my ankles, that I could not lay
down in any other manner than on my back. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was put into the lowest and most wretched part
of the vessel, where I got the favor of a chest to
sit on; the same answered for my bed at night;
and having procured some little blocks of the
guard, who day and night, with fixed bayonets
watched over me, to lie under each end of the
large bar of my leg irons, to preserve my ankles
from galling while I sat on the chest or lay back
on the same, though most of the time, night and
day, I sat on it; but at length having a desire to
lie down on my side, which the closeness of my
irons forbid, I desired the captain to loosen them
for that purpose, but was denied the favor. The
captain's name was Royal, who did not seem to
be an ill-natured man, but oftentimes said that
his express orders were to treat me with such severity,
which was disagreeable to his own feelings;
nor did he ever insult me, though many others
who came on board did. One of the officers, by
the name of Bradley, was very generous to me;
he would often send me victuals from his own
table; nor did a day fail, but he sent me a good
drink of grog.</p>

<p>The reader is now invited back to the time I
was put into irons. I requested the privilege to
write to General Prescott, which was granted. I
reminded him of the kind and generous manner
of my treatment of the prisoners I took at Ticonderoga;
the injustice and ungentlemanlike usage
I had met with from him, and demanded better
usage, but received no answer from him. I soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
after wrote to General Carleton, which met the
same success. In the mean while, many of those
who were permitted to see me were very insulting.</p>

<p>I was confined in the manner I have related,
on board the <i>Gaspee</i> schooner, about six weeks,
during which time I was obliged to throw out
plenty of extravagant language, which answered
certain purposes, at that time, better than to grace
a history.</p>

<p>To give an instance: upon being insulted, in a
fit of anger, I twisted off a nail with my teeth,
which I took to be a ten-penny nail; it went
through the mortise of the band of my handcuff,
and at the same time I swaggered over those who
abused me, particularly a Doctor Dace, who told
me that I was outlawed by New York, and deserved
death for several years past; was at last
fully ripened for the halter, and in a fair way to
obtain it. When I challenged him, he excused
himself, in consequence, as he said, of my being
a criminal; but I flung such a flood of language at
him that it shocked him and the spectators, for
my anger was very great. I heard one say, "Him!
he can eat iron!" After that, a small padlock was
fixed to the handcuff instead of the nail, and as
they were mean-spirited in their treatment to me,
so it appeared to me that they were equally timorous
and cowardly.</p>

<p>I was after sent with the prisoners taken with
me to an armed vessel in the river, which lay off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
against Quebec under the command of Captain
M'Cloud of the British, who treated me in a very
generous and obliging manner, and according to
my rank; in about twenty-four hours I bid him
farewell with regret, but my good fortune still
continued. The name of the captain of the vessel
I was put on board was Littlejohn, who with
his officers behaved in a polite, generous, and
friendly manner. I lived with them in the cabin
and fared on the best, my irons being taken off,
contrary to the order he had received from the
commanding officer, but Captain Littlejohn swore
that a brave man should not be used as a rascal
on board his ship.</p>

<p>That I found myself in possession of happiness
once more, and the evils I had lately suffered
gave me an uncommon relish for it.</p>

<p>Captain Littlejohn used to go to Quebec almost
every day in order to pay his respects to certain
gentlemen and ladies; being there on a certain
day, he happened to meet with some disagreeable
treatment as he imagined, from a Lieutenant of a
man-of-war and one word brought on another, until
the Lieutenant challenged him to a duel on the
plains of Abraham. Captain Littlejohn was a
gentleman, who entertained a high sense of honor,
and could do no less than accept the challenge.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the next morning they were to
fight. The captain returned in the evening, and
acquainted his lieutenant and me with the affair.
His lieutenant was a high-blooded Scotchman, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
well as himself, who replied to his captain that
he should not want for a second. With this I interrupted
him and gave the captain to understand
that since an opportunity had presented, I would
be glad to testify my gratitude to him by acting
the part of a faithful second; on which he gave
me his hand, and said that he wanted no better
man. Says he, I am a king's officer, and you a
prisoner under my care; you must therefore go
with me to the place appointed in disguise, and
added further: "You must engage me, upon the
honor of a gentleman, that whether I die or live,
or whatever happens, provided you live, that you
will return to my lieutenant on board this ship."
All this I solemnly engaged him. The combatants
were to discharge each a pocket pistol, and
then to fall on with their iron-hilted muckle
whangers, and one of that sort was allotted for
me; but some British officers, who interposed
early in the morning, settled the controversy without
fighting.</p>

<p>Now having enjoyed eight or nine days' happiness
from the polite and generous treatment of
Captain Littlejohn and his officers, I was obliged
to bid them farewell, parting with them in as
friendly a manner as we had lived together, which,
to the best of my memory, was the eleventh of
November; when a detachment of General Arnold's
little army appeared on Point Levi, opposite
Quebec, who had performed an extraordinary
march through a wilderness country with design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to have surprised the capital of Canada; I was
then taken on board a vessel called the <i>Adamant</i>,
together with the prisoners taken with me, and
put under the power of an English merchant from
London, whose name was Brook Watson; a man
of malicious and cruel disposition, and who was
probably excited, in the exercise of his malevolence,
by a junto of tories who sailed with him
to England; among whom were Colonel Guy
Johnson, Colonel Closs, and their attendants and
associates, to the number of about thirty.</p>

<p>All the ship's crew, Colonel Closs in his personal
behavior excepted, behaved toward the prisoners
with that spirit of bitterness which is the
peculiar characteristic of tories when they have
the friends of America in their power, measuring
their loyalty to the English king by the barbarity,
fraud and deceit which they exercised toward
the whigs.</p>

<p>A small place in the vessel, inclosed with white-oak
plank, was assigned for the prisoners, and for
me among the rest. I should imagine that it was
not more than twenty feet one way, and twenty-two
the other. Into this place we were all, to the
number of thirty-four, thrust and handcuffed, two
prisoners more being added to our number, and
were provided with two excrement tubs; in this
circumference we were obliged to eat and perform
the offices of evacuation during the voyage to
England, and were insulted by every blackguard
sailor and tory on board, in the cruellest manner;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
but what is the most surprising thing is, that not
one of us died in the passage. When I was first
ordered to go into the filthy inclosure, through a
small sort of door, I positively refused, and endeavored
to reason the before-named Brook Watson
out of a conduct so derogatory to every sentiment
of honor and humanity, but all to no purpose, my
men being forced in the den already; and the
rascal who had the charge of the prisoners commanded
me to go immediately in among the rest.
He further added, that the place was good enough
for a rebel; that it was impertinent for a capital
offender to talk of honor or humanity; that anything
short of a halter was too good for me, and
that would be my portion soon after I landed in
England, for which purpose only I was sent
thither. About the same time a lieutenant among
the tories insulted me in a grievous manner, saying
I ought to have been executed for my rebellion
against New York, and spit in my face, upon
which, though I was in handcuffs, I sprang at
him with both hands and knocked him partly
down, but he scrambled along into the cabin, and
I after him; there he got under the protection of
some men with fixed bayonets, who were ordered
to make ready to drive me into the place aforementioned.
I challenged him to fight, notwithstanding
the impediments that were on my hands,
and had the exalted pleasure to see the rascal
tremble for fear; his name I have forgot, but Watson
ordered his guard to get me into the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with the other prisoners, dead or alive; and I had
almost as lieve died as do it, standing it out till
they environed me round with bayonets, and brutish,
prejudiced, abandoned wretches they were,
from whom I could expect nothing but wounds or
death; however, I told them that they were good
honest fellows, that I could not blame them; that
I was only in dispute with a calico merchant, who
knew not how to behave toward a gentleman of
the military establishment. This was spoken
rather to appease them for my own preservation,
as well as to treat Watson with contempt; but still
I found they were determined to force me into the
wretched circumstances, which their prejudiced
and depraved minds had prepared for me; therefore,
rather than die I submitted to their indignities,
being drove with bayonets into the filthy
dungeon with the other prisoners, where we were
denied fresh water, except a small allowance,
which was very inadequate to our wants; and in
consequence of the stench of the place, each of us
was soon followed with a diarrhœa and fever,
which occasioned intolerable thirst. When we
asked for water, we were, most commonly, instead
of obtaining it, insulted and derided; and to add to
all the horrors of the place, it was so dark that we
could not see each other, and were overspread with
body-lice. We had, notwithstanding these severities,
full allowance of salt provisions, and a gill of
rum per day; the latter of which was of the utmost
service to us, and, probably, was the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
saving several of our lives. About forty days we
existed in this manner, when the land's end of
England was discovered from the mast head; soon
after which, the prisoners were taken from their
gloomy abode, being permitted to see the light of
the sun, and breathe fresh air, which to us was
very refreshing. The day following we landed at
Falmouth.</p>

<p>A few days before I was taken prisoner I shifted
my clothes, by which I happened to be taken in
a Canadian dress, viz., a short fawn-skin jacket,
double breasted, an undervest and breeches of
sagathy, worsted stockings, a decent pair of shoes,
two plain shirts, and a red worsted cap; this was
all the clothing I had, in which I made my appearance
in England.</p>

<p>When the prisoners were landed, multitudes of
the citizens of Falmouth, excited by curiosity,
crowded to see us, which was equally gratifying
to us. I saw numbers on the house tops and the
rising adjacent grounds were covered with them,
of both sexes. The throng was so great, that the
king's officers were obliged to draw their swords,
and force a passage to Pendennis castle, which
was near a mile from the town, where we were
closely confined, in consequence of orders from
General Carleton, who then commanded in Canada.</p>

BOARD THE "SOLEBAY."&mdash;ATTENTIONS RECEIVED
IN IRELAND AND MADEIRA.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rascally Brook Watson then set out for London
in great haste, expecting the reward of his
zeal; but the ministry received him, as I have
been since informed, rather coolly; but the minority
in parliament took advantage, arguing that
the opposition of America to Great Britain was
not a rebellion. If it is, say they, why do you not
execute Colonel Allen according to law? but the
majority argued that I ought to be executed, and
that the opposition was really a rebellion, but that
policy obliged them not to do it, inasmuch as the
congress had then most prisoners in their power;
so that my being sent to England, for the purpose
of being executed, and necessity restraining them,
was rather a foil on their laws and authority, and
they consequently disapproved of my being sent
thither. But I had never heard the least hint of
those debates in parliament, or of the working of
their policy, until some time after I left England.</p>

<p>Consequently the reader will readily conceive I
was anxious about my preservation, knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I was in the power of a haughty and cruel nation
considered as such. Therefore, the first proposition
which I determined in my own mind was, that
humanity and moral suasion would not be consulted
in the determining of my fate; and those
that daily came in great numbers out of curiosity
to see me, both gentle and simple, united in this,
that I would be hanged. A gentleman from America,
by the name of Temple, and who was friendly
to me, just whispered to me in the ear, and told
me that bets were laid in London, that I would be
executed; he likewise privately gave me a guinea,
but durst say but little to me.</p>

<p>However, agreeably to my first negative proposition,
that moral virtue would not influence my
destiny, I had recourse to stratagem, which I was
in hopes would move in the circle of their policy.
I requested of the commander of the castle, the
privilege of writing to congress, who, after consulting
with an officer that lived in town, of a superior
rank, permitted me to write. I wrote in
the fore part of the letter, a short narrative of my
ill-treatment; but withal let them know that,
though I was treated as a criminal in England,
and continued in irons, together with those taken
with me, yet it was, in consequence of the orders
which the commander of the castle received from
General Carleton, and therefore desired congress
to desist from matters of retaliation, until they
should know the result of the government in England
respecting their treatment toward me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the prisoners with me, and govern themselves accordingly,
with a particular request that, if retaliation
should be found necessary, it might be
exercised not according to the smallness of my
character in America, but in proportion to the importance
of the cause for which I suffered. This
is, according to my present recollection, the substance
of the letter inscribed: "To the illustrious
Continental Congress." This letter was written
with the view that it should be sent to the ministry
at London, rather than to congress, with a
design to intimidate the haughty English government,
and screen my neck from the halter.</p>

<p>The next day the officer, from whom I obtained
license to write, came to see me and frowned on
me on account of the impudence of the letter, as
he phrased it, and further added, "Do you think
that we are fools in England, and would send your
letter to congress, with instructions to retaliate on
our own people? I have sent your letter to Lord
North." This gave me inward satisfaction, though
I carefully concealed it with a pretended resentment,
for I found that I had come Yankee over
him, and that the letter had gone to the identical
person I designed it for. Nor do I know to this
day, but that it had the desired effect, though I
have not heard anything of the letter since.</p>

<p>My personal treatment by Lieutenant Hamilton,
who commanded the castle, was very generous.
He sent me every day a fine breakfast and dinner
from his own table, and a bottle of good wine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Another aged gentleman, whose name I cannot recollect,
sent me a good supper. But there was no
distinction between me and the privates; we all
lodged in a sort of Dutch bunks, in one common
apartment, and were allowed straw. The privates
were well supplied with provisions, and with me,
took effectual measures to rid themselves of lice.</p>

<p>I could not but feel, inwardly, extremely anxious
for my fate. This I, however, concealed from the
prisoners, as well as from the enemy, who were
perpetually shaking the halter at me. I nevertheless
treated them with scorn and contempt; and
having sent my letter to the ministry, could conceive
of nothing more in my power but to keep up
my spirits, behave in a daring, soldier-like manner,
that I might exhibit a good sample of American
fortitude. Such a conduct, I judged, would
have a more probable tendency to my preservation
than concession and timidity. This, therefore,
was my deportment: and I had lastly determined
in my mind, that if a cruel death must inevitably
be my portion, I would face it undaunted; and
though I greatly rejoice that I returned to my
country and friends, and to see the power and
pride of Great Britain humbled, yet I am confident
I could then have died without the least appearance
of dismay.</p>

<p>I now clearly recollect that my mind was so resolved
that I would not have trembled or shown
the least fear, as I was sensible that it could not
alter my fate, nor do more than reproach my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
memory, make my last act despicable to my
enemies, and eclipse the other actions of my life.
For I reasoned thus, that nothing was more common
than for men to die with their friends around
them, weeping and lamenting over them, but not
able to help them, which was in reality not different
in the consequence of it from such a death as
I was apprehensive of; and as death was the natural
consequence of animal life to which the laws
of nature subject mankind, to be timorous and uneasy
as to the event and manner of it was inconsistent
with the character of a philosopher and
soldier. The cause I was engaged in I ever viewed
worthy hazarding my life for, nor was I, in the
most critical moments of trouble, sorry that I engaged
in it; and as to the world of spirits, though
I knew nothing of the mode or manner of it, I expected
nevertheless, when I should arrive at such
a world, that I should be as well treated as other
gentlemen of my merit.</p>

<p>Among the great numbers of people who came
to the castle to see the prisoners, some gentlemen
told me that they had come fifty miles on purpose
to see me, and desired to ask me a number of
questions, and to make free with me in conversation.
I gave for answer that I chose freedom in
every sense of the word. Then one of them asked
me what my occupation in life had been. I answered
him, that in my younger days I had studied
divinity but was a conjuror by profession. He
replied that I conjured wrong at the time I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
taken; and I was obliged to own that I mistook a
figure at that time, but that I had conjured them
out of Ticonderoga. This was a place of great
notoriety in England, so that the joke seemed to
go in my favor.</p>

<p>It was a common thing for me to be taken out
of close confinement, into a spacious green in the
castle, or rather parade, where numbers of gentlemen
and ladies were ready to see and hear me. I
often entertained such audiences with harangues
on the impracticability of Great Britain's conquering
the colonies of America. At one of these
times I asked a gentleman for a bowl of punch,
and he ordered his servant to bring it, which he
did, and offered it to me, but I refused to take it
from the hand of his servant; he then gave it to
me with his own hand, refusing to drink with me
in consequence of my being a state criminal.
However, I took the punch and drank it all down
at one draught, and handed the gentleman the
bowl; this made the spectators as well as myself
merry.</p>

<p>I expatiated on American freedom. This
gained the resentment of a young beardless gentleman
of the company, who gave himself very great
airs, and replied that he knew the Americans very
well, and was certain <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'thy'">they</ins> could not bear the smell
of powder. I replied that I accepted it as a challenge,
and was ready to convince him on the spot
that an American could bear the smell of powder;
at which he answered that he should not put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>self
on a par with me. I then demanded him to
treat the character of the Americans with due respect.
He answered that I was an Irishman; but
I assured him that I was a full-blooded Yankee,
and in fine bantered him so much, that he left me
in possession of the ground, and the laugh went
against him. Two clergymen came to see me,
and inasmuch as they behaved with civility, I returned
them the same. We discoursed on several
parts of moral philosophy and Christianity; and
they seemed to be surprised that I should be acquainted
with such topics, or that I should understand
a syllogism or regular mode of argumentation.
I am apprehensive my Canadian dress
contributed not a little to the surprise and excitement
of curiosity: to see a gentleman in England
regularly dressed and well behaved would be no
sight at all; but such a rebel as they were pleased
to call me, it is probable, was never before seen
in England.</p>

<p>The prisoners were landed at Falmouth a few
days before Christmas, and ordered on board of
the <i>Solebay</i> frigate, Captain Symonds, on the eighth
day of January, 1776, when our hand irons were
taken off. This remove was in consequence, as I
have been since informed, of a writ of habeas
corpus, which had been procured by some gentlemen
in England, in order to obtain me my liberty.</p>

<p>The <i>Solebay</i>, with sundry other men-of-war and
about forty transports, rendezvoused at the cove of
Cork, in Ireland, to take in provisions and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>When we were first brought on board, Captain
Symonds ordered all the prisoners and most of
the hands on board to go on the deck, and caused
to be read in their hearing a certain code of laws
or rules for the regulation and ordering of their
behavior; and then in a sovereign manner, ordered
the prisoners, me in particular, off the deck and
never to come on it again: for, said he, this is a
place for gentlemen to walk. So I went off, an
officer following me, who told me he would show
me the place allotted to me, and took me down to
the cabin tier, saying to me this is your place.</p>

<p>Prior to this I had taken cold, by which I was in
an ill state of health, and did not say much to the
officer; but stayed there that night, consulted my
policy, and I found I was in an evil case: that a
captain of a man-of-war was more arbitrary than
a king, as he could view his territory with a look
of his eye, and a movement of his finger commanded
obedience. I felt myself more desponding
than I had done at any time before; for I concluded
it to be a government scheme, to do that
clandestinely which policy forbid to be done under
sanction of any public justice and law.</p>

<p>However, two days after, I shaved and cleansed
myself as well as I could, and went on deck. The
captain spoke to me in a great rage, and said:
"Did I not order you not to come on deck?" I
answered him, that at the same time he said,
"that it was the place for gentlemen to walk; that
I was Colonel Allen, but had not been properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
introduced to him." He replied, "&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; you,
sir, be careful not to walk the same side of the deck
that I do." This gave me encouragement, and ever
after that I walked in the manner he had directed,
except when he, at certain times afterward, had
ordered me off in a passion, and I then would directly
afterward go on again, telling him to command
his slaves; that I was a gentleman and had
a right to walk the deck; yet when he expressly
ordered me off I obeyed, not out of obedience to
him, but to set an example to the ship's crew, who
ought to obey him.</p>

<p>To walk to the windward side of the deck is, according
to custom, the prerogative of the captain
of the man-of-war, though he, sometimes, nay
commonly, walks with his lieutenants, when no
strangers are by. When a captain from some
other man-of-war comes on board, the captains
walk to the windward side, and the other gentlemen
to the leeward.</p>

<p>It was but a few nights I lodged in the cabin
tier before I gained an acquaintance with the
master of arms; his name was Gillegan, an Irishman,
who was a generous and well-disposed man,
and in a friendly manner made me an offer of living
with him in a little berth, which was allotted
him between decks, and inclosed in canvas; his
preferment on board was about equal to that of a
sergeant in a regiment. I was comparatively
happy in the acceptance of his clemency, and lived
with him in friendship till the frigate anchored in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the harbor of Cape Fear, North Carolina, in America.</p>

<p>Nothing of material consequence happened till
the fleet rendezvoused at the cove of Cork, except
a violent storm which brought old hardy sailors
to their prayers. It was soon rumored in Cork
that I was on board the <i>Solebay</i>, with a number
of prisoners from America, upon which Messrs.
Clark &amp; Hays, merchants in company, and a number
of other benevolently disposed gentlemen,
contributed largely to the relief and support of
the prisoners, who were thirty-four in number, and
in very needy circumstances. A suit of clothes
from head to foot, including an overcoat or surtout,
and two shirts were bestowed upon each of
them. My suit I received in superfine broadcloth,
sufficient for two jackets and two pairs of
breeches, overplus of a suit throughout, eight fine
Holland shirts and socks ready made, with a number
of pairs of silk and worsted hose, two pairs of
shoes, two beaver hats, one of which was sent me,
richly laced with gold, by James Bonwell. The
Irish gentlemen furthermore made a large gratuity
of wines of the best sort, spirits, gin, loaf and
brown sugar, tea and chocolate, with a large round
of pickled beef, and a number of fat turkies, with
many other articles, for my sea stores, too tedious
to mention here. To the privates they bestowed
on each man two pounds of tea and six pounds of
brown sugar. These articles were received on
board at a time when the captain and first lieuten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>ant
were gone on shore, by the permission of the
second lieutenant, a handsome young gentleman,
who was then under twenty-one years of age; his
name was Douglass, son of Admiral Douglass, as I
was informed.</p>

<p>As this munificence was so unexpected and
plentiful, I may add needful, it impressed on my
mind the highest sense of gratitude toward my
benefactors; for I was not only supplied with the
necessaries and conveniences of life, but with the
grandeurs and superfluities of it. Mr. Hays, one
of the donators before-mentioned, came on board
and behaved in the most obliging manner, telling
me that he hoped my troubles were past, for that
the gentlemen of Cork determined to make my sea
stores equal to that of the captain of the <i>Solebay</i>;
he made an offer of live-stock and wherewith to
support them; but I knew this would be denied.
And to crown all, did send me by another person
fifty guineas, but I could not reconcile receiving
the whole to my own feelings, as it might have
the appearance of avarice, and therefore received
but seven guineas only, and am confident, not only
from the exercises of the present well-timed generosity,
but from a large acquaintance with
gentlemen of this nation, that as a people they excel
in liberality and bravery.</p>

<p>Two days after the receipt of the aforesaid donations,
Captain Symonds came on board full of
envy toward the prisoners, and swore by all that
is good that the damned American rebels should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
not be feasted at this rate by the damned rebels
of Ireland; he therefore took away all my liquors
before-mentioned, except some of the wine which
was secreted, and a two-gallon jug of old spirits
which was reserved for me per favor of Lieutenant
Douglass. The taking of my liquors was abominable
in his sight. He therefore spoke in my
behalf, till the captain was angry with him, and
in consequence proceeded and took away all the
tea and sugar which had been given to the prisoners,
and confiscated it to the use of the ship's
crew. Our clothing was not taken away, but the
privates were forced to do duty on board. Soon
after this there came a boat to the side of the ship
and Captain Symonds asked a gentleman in it, in
my hearing, what his business was, who answered
that he was sent to deliver some sea stores to Colonel
Allen, which, if I remember right, he said
were sent from Dublin; but the captain damned
him heartily, ordering him away from the ship, and
would not suffer him to deliver the stores. I was
furthermore informed that the gentlemen in Cork
requested of Captain Symonds that I might be
allowed to come into the city, and that they would
be responsible I should return to the frigate at a
given time, which was denied them.</p>

<p>We sailed from England on the 8th day of January,
and from the cove of Cork on the 12th day
of February. Just before we sailed, the prisoners
with me were divided and put on board three
different ships of war. This gave me some un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>easiness,
for they were to a man zealous in the
cause of liberty, and behaved with a becoming
fortitude in the various scenes of their captivity;
but those who were distributed on board other
ships of war were much better used than those
who tarried with me, as appeared afterward.
When the fleet, consisting of about forty-five sail,
including five men-of-war, sailed from the cove
with a fresh breeze, the appearance was beautiful,
abstracted from the unjust and bloody designs they
had in view. We had not sailed many days before
a mighty storm arose, which lasted near
twenty-four hours without intermission. The
wind blew with relentless fury, and no man could
remain on deck, except he was lashed fast, for the
waves rolled over the deck by turns, with a forcible
rapidity, and every soul on board was anxious
for the preservation of the ship, alias their
lives. In this storm the <i>Thunder-bomb</i> man-of-war
sprang <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'aleak'">a leak</ins>, and was afterward floated to some
part of the coast of England, and the crew saved.
We were then said to be in the Bay of Biscay.
After the storm abated, I could plainly discern the
prisoners were better used for some considerable
time.</p>

<p>Nothing of consequence happened after this,
till we sailed to the island of Madeira, except a
certain favor I had received of Captain Symonds,
in consequence of an application I made to him
for the privilege of his tailor to make me a suit of
clothes of the cloth bestowed on me in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which he generously granted. I could then walk
the deck with a seeming better grace. When we
had reached Madeira and anchored, sundry gentlemen
with the captain went on shore, who, I
conclude, gave the rumor that I was in the frigate,
upon which I soon found that Irish generosity was
again excited; for a gentleman of that nation sent
his clerk on board to know of me if I could accept
a sea store from him, particularly wine. This
matter I made known to the generous Lieutenant
Douglass, who readily granted me the favor, provided
the articles could be brought on board during
the time of his command; adding that it would
be a pleasure to him to serve me, notwithstanding
the opposition he met with before. So I directed
the gentleman's clerk to inform him that I was
greatly in need of so signal a charity, and desired
the young gentleman to make the utmost dispatch,
which he did; but in the mean time Captain Symonds
and his officers came on board, and immediately
made ready for sailing; the wind at the
same time being fair, set sail when the young
gentleman was in fair sight with the aforesaid
store.</p>

<p>The reader will doubtless recollect the seven
guineas I received at the cove of Cork. These
enabled me to purchase of the purser what I
wanted, had not the captain strictly forbidden it,
though I made sundry applications to him for that
purpose; but his answer to me, when I was sick,
was, that it was no matter how soon I was dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and that he was no ways anxious to preserve the
lives of rebels, but wished them all dead; and indeed
that was the language of most of the ship's
crew. I expostulated not only with the captain, but
with other gentlemen on board, on the unreasonableness
of such usage; inferring that inasmuch
as the government in England did not proceed
against me as a capital offender, they should not;
for that they were by no means empowered by
any authority, either civil or military, to do so;
for the English government had acquitted me by
sending me back a prisoner of war to America,
and that they should treat me as such. I further
drew an inference of impolicy on them, provided
they should by hard usage destroy my life; inasmuch
as I might, if living, redeem one of their
officers; but the captain replied that he needed
no directions of mine how to treat a rebel; that
the British would conquer the American rebels,
hang the Congress and such as promoted the rebellion,
me in particular, and retake their own prisoners;
so that my life was of no consequence in
the scale of their policy. I gave him for answer
that if they stayed till they conquered America
before they hanged me, I should die of old age,
and desired that till such an event took place, he
would at least allow me to purchase of the purser,
for my own money, such articles as I greatly
needed; but he would not permit it, and when I
reminded him of the generous and civil usage that
their prisoners in captivity in America met with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he said that it was not owing to their goodness,
but to their timidity; for, said he, they expect to
be conquered, and therefore dare not misuse our
prisoners; and in fact this was the language of the
British officers till Burgoyne was taken; happy
event! and not only of the officers but the whole
British army. I appeal to all my brother prisoners
who have been with the British in the
southern department for a confirmation of what I
have advanced on this subject. The surgeon of
the <i>Solebay</i>, whose name was North, was a very
humane, obliging man, and took the best care of
the prisoners who were sick.</p>

<p class="pfs70">RENDEZVOUS AT CAPE FEAR.&mdash;SICKNESS.&mdash;HALIFAX
JAIL.&mdash;LETTER TO GENERAL MASSEY.&mdash;VOYAGE
TO NEW YORK.&mdash;ON PAROLE.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The third day of May we cast anchor in the harbor
of Cape Fear, in North Carolina, as did Sir
Peter Parker's ship, of fifty guns, a little back of
the bar; for there was not depth of water for him
to come into the harbor. These two men-of-war,
and fourteen sail of transports and others, came
after, so that most of the fleet rendezvoused at
Cape Fear for three weeks. The soldiers on
board the transports were sickly, in consequence
of so long a passage; add to this the small-pox
carried off many of them. They landed on the
main, and formed a camp; but the riflemen annoyed
them, and caused them to move to an island
in the harbor; but such cursing of riflemen I
never heard.</p>

<p>A detachment of regulars was sent up Brunswick
River; as they landed they were fired on by
those marksmen, and they came back next day
damning the rebels for their unmanly way of
fighting, and swearing they would give no quarter,
for they took sight at them, and were behind tim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>ber,
skulking about. One of the detachments said
they lost one man; but a negro man who was with
them, and heard what was said, soon after told me
that he helped to bury thirty-one of them; this
did me some good to find my countrymen giving
them battle; for I never heard such swaggering
as among General Clinton's little army, who commanded
at that time; and I am apt to think there
were four thousand men, though not two-thirds of
them fit for duty. I heard numbers of them say
that the trees in America should hang well with
fruit that campaign, for they would give no quarter.
This was in the mouths of most who I heard
speak on the subject, officer as well as soldier. I
wished at that time my countrymen knew, as
well as I did, what a murdering and cruel enemy
they had to deal with; but experience has since
taught this country what they are to expect at the
hands of Britons when in their power.</p>

<p>The prisoners who had been sent on board different
men-of-war at the cove of Cork were collected
together, and the whole of them put on
board the <i>Mercury</i> frigate, Captain James Montague,
except one of the Canadians, who died on the
passage from Ireland, and Peter Noble, who made
his escape from the <i>Sphynx</i> man-of-war in this
harbor, and, by extraordinary swimming, got safe
home to New England and gave intelligence of
the usage of his brother prisoners. The <i>Mercury</i>
set sail from this port for Halifax about the 20th
of May, and Sir Peter Parker was about to sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with the land forces, under the command of General
Clinton, for the reduction of Charleston, the capital
of South Carolina, and when I heard of his
defeat in Halifax, it gave me inexpressible satisfaction.</p>

<p>I now found myself under a worse captain than
Symonds; for Montague was loaded with prejudices
against everybody and everything that
was not stamped with royalty; and being by nature
underwitted, his wrath was heavier than the
others, or at least his mind was in no instance
liable to be diverted by good sense, humor or
bravery, of which Symonds was by turns susceptible.
A Captain Francis Proctor was added to our
number of prisoners when we were first put on
board this ship. This gentleman had formerly
belonged to the English service. The captain,
and in fine, all the gentlemen of the ship were
very much incensed against him, and put him in
irons without the least provocation, and he was continued
in this miserable situation about three
months. In this passage the prisoners were infected
with the scurvy, some more and some less,
but most of them severely. The ship's crew was
to a great degree troubled with it, and I concluded
it was catching. Several of the crew died
with it on their passage. I was weak and feeble
in consequence of so long and cruel a captivity,
yet had but little of the scurvy.</p>

<p>The purser was again expressly forbid by the
captain to let me have anything out of his store;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
upon which I went upon deck, and in the handsomest
manner requested the favor of purchasing
a few necessaries of the purser, which was denied
me; he further told me, that I should be hanged
as soon as I arrived at Halifax. I tried to reason
the matter with him, but found him proof against
reason; I also held up his honor to view, and his
behavior to me and the prisoners in general, as
being derogatory to it, but found his honor impenetrable.
I then endeavored to touch his humanity,
but found he had none; for his prepossession
of bigotry to his own party had confirmed
him in an opinion that no humanity was due to
unroyalists, but seemed to think that heaven and
earth were made merely to gratify the king and
his creatures; he uttered considerable unintelligible
and grovelling ideas, a little tinctured with
monarchy but stood well to his text of hanging
me. He afterward forbade his surgeon to administer
any help to the sick prisoners. I was every
night shut down in the cable tier with the rest of
the prisoners, and we all lived miserably while
under his power. But I received some generosity
from several of the midshipmen who in degree
alleviated my misery; one of their names was
Putrass; the names of the others I do not recollect;
but they were obliged to be private in the bestowment
of their favor, which was sometimes
good wine bitters and at others a generous drink
of grog.</p>

<p>Some time in the first week of June, we came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
anchor at the Hook of New York, where we remained
but three days; in which time Governor
Tryon, Mr. Kemp, the old attorney-general of
New York, and several other perfidious and overgrown
tories and land-jobbers, came on board.
Tryon viewed me with a stern countenance, as I
was walking on the leeward side of the deck with
the midshipmen; and he and his companions were
walking with the captain and lieutenant on the
windward side of the same, but never spoke to me,
though it is altogether probable that he thought
of the old quarrel between him, the old government
of New York, and the Green Mountain Boys.
Then they went with the captain into the cabin,
and the same afternoon returned on board a vessel,
where at that time they took sanctuary from the
resentment of their injured country. What passed
between the officers of the ship and these visitors
I know not; but this I know, that my treatment
from the officers was more severe afterward.</p>

<p>We arrived at Halifax not far from the middle
of June, where the ship's crew, which was infested
with the scurvy, were taken on shore and shallow
trenches dug, into which they were put, and partly
covered with earth. Indeed, every proper measure
was taken for their relief. The prisoners were not
permitted any sort of medicine, but were put on
board a sloop which lay in the harbor, near the
town of Halifax, surrounded by several men-of-war
and their tenders, and a guard constantly set
over them, night and day. The sloop we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wholly to ourselves, except the guard who occupied
the forecastle; here we were cruelly pinched with
hunger; it seemed to me that we had not more
than one-third of the common allowance. We
were all seized with violent hunger and faintness;
we divided our scanty allowance as exact as possible.
I shared the same fate with the rest, and
though they offered me more than an even share,
I refused to accept it, as it was a time of substantial
distress, which in my opinion I ought to
partake equally with the rest, and set an example
of virtue and fortitude to our little commonwealth.</p>

<p>I sent letter after letter to Captain Montague,
who still had the care of us, and also to his lieutenant,
whose name I cannot call to mind, but
could obtain no answer, much less a redress of
grievances; and to add to the calamity, nearly a
dozen of the prisoners were dangerously ill of the
scurvy. I wrote private letters to the doctors, to
procure, if possible, some remedy for the sick, but
in vain. The chief physician came by in a boat,
so close that the oars touched the sloop that we
were in, and I uttered my complaint in the genteelest
manner to him, but he never so much as
turned his head, or made me any answer, though
I continued speaking till he got out of hearing.
Our cause then became deplorable. Still I kept
writing to the captain, till he ordered the guards,
as they told me, not to bring any more letters
from me to him. In the mean time an event happened
worth relating. One of the men, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dead with the scurvy, lay by the side of the sloop,
and a canoe of Indians coming by, he purchased
two quarts of strawberries, and ate them at once,
and it almost cured him. The money he gave for
them was all the money he had in the world.
After that we tried every way to procure more of
that fruit, reasoning from analogy that they might
have the same effect on others infested with the
same disease, but could obtain none.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doctor's mate of the <i>Mercury</i>
came privately on board the prison sloop and presented
me with a large vial of smart drops, which
proved to be good for the scurvy, though vegetables
and some other ingredients were requisite for
a cure: but the drops gave at least a check to the
disease. This was a well-timed exertion of humanity,
but the doctor's name has slipped my
mind, and in my opinion, it was the means of saving
the lives of several men.</p>

<p>The guard which was set over us was by this
time touched with feelings of compassion; and I
finally trusted one of them with a letter of complaint
to Governor Arbuthnot, of Halifax, which
he found means to communicate, and which had
the desired effect; for the governor sent an officer
and surgeon on board the prison sloop to know
the truth of the complaint. The officer's name
was Russell; he held the rank of lieutenant, and
treated me in a friendly and polite manner, and
was really angry at the cruel and unmanly usage
the prisoners met with; and with the surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
made a true report of matters to Governor Arbuthnot,
who, either by his order or influence, took us
next day from the prison sloop to Halifax jail,
where I first became acquainted with the now
Hon. James Lovel, one of the members of Congress
for the State of Massachusetts. The sick
were taken to the hospital, and the Canadians,
who were effective, were employed in the king's
works; and when their countrymen were recovered
from the scurvy and joined them, they all deserted
the king's employ, and were not heard of at Halifax
as long as the remainder of the prisoners continued
there, which was till near the middle of
October. We were on board the prison sloop
about six weeks, and were landed at Halifax near
the middle of August. Several of our English-American
prisoners, who were cured of the scurvy
at the hospital, made their escape from thence,
and after a long time reached their old habitations.</p>

<p>I had now but thirteen with me of those who
were taken in Canada, and remained in jail with
me at Halifax, who, in addition to those that were
imprisoned before, made our number about thirty-four,
who were all locked up in one common large
room, without regard to rank, education, or any
other accomplishment, where we continued from
the setting to the rising sun; and as sundry of
them were infected with the jail and other distempers,
the furniture of this spacious room consisted
principally of excrement tubs. We petitioned
for a removal of the sick into the hospitals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but were denied. We remonstrated against the
ungenerous usage of being confined with the privates,
as being contrary to the laws and customs
of nations, and particularly ungrateful in them in
consequence of the gentleman-like usage which
the British imprisoned officers met with in America;
and thus we wearied ourselves, petitioning
and remonstrating, but to no purpose at all; for
General Massey, who commanded at Halifax, was
as inflexible as the devil himself, a fine preparative
this for Mr. Lovel, member of the Continental
Congress.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell, whom I have mentioned
before, came to visit me in prison, and assured
me that he had done his utmost to procure my
parole for enlargement; at which a British captain,
who was then town-major, expressed compassion
for the gentlemen confined in the filthy
place, and assured me that he had used his influence
to procure their enlargement; his name was
near like Ramsey. Among the prisoners there
were four in number who had a legal claim to a
parole, a Mr. Howland, master of a continental
armed vessel, a Mr. Taylor, his mate, and myself.</p>

<p>As to the article of provision, we were well
served, much better than in any part of my captivity;
and since it was Mr. Lovel's misfortune and
mine to be prisoners, and in so wretched circumstances,
I was happy that we were together as a
mutual support to each other and to the unfortunate
prisoners with us. Our first attention was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the preservation of ourselves and injured little republic;
the rest of our time we devoted interchangeably
to politics and philosophy, as patience
was a needful exercise in so evil a situation, but
contentment mean and impracticable.</p>

<p>I had not been in this jail many days, before a
worthy and charitable woman, by the name of
Mrs. Blacden, supplied me with a good dinner of
fresh meats every day, with garden fruit, and
sometimes with a bottle of wine; notwithstanding
which I had not been more than three weeks in
this place before I lost my appetite to the most
delicious food by the jail distemper, as also did
sundry of the prisoners, particularly Sergeant
Moore, a man of courage and fidelity. I have
several times seen him hold the boatswain of the
<i>Solebay</i> frigate, when he attempted to strike him,
and laughed him out of conceit of using him as a
slave.</p>

<p>A doctor visited the sick, and did the best, as I
suppose, he could for them, to no apparent purpose.
I grew weaker and weaker, as did the rest.
Several of them could not help themselves. At
last I reasoned in my own mind that raw onion
would be good. I made use of it, and found immediate
relief by it, as did the sick in general,
particularly Sergeant Moore, whom it recovered
almost from the shades; though I had met with a
little revival, still I found the malignant hand of
Britain had greatly reduced my constitution with
stroke upon stroke. Esquire Lovel and myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
used every argument and entreaty that could be
well conceived of in order to obtain gentleman-like
usage, to no purpose. I then wrote General
Massey as severe a letter as I possibly could with
my friend Lovel's assistance. The contents of it
was to give the British, as a nation, and him as
an individual, their true character. This roused
the rascal, for he could not bear to see his and the
nation's deformity in that transparent letter, which
I sent him; he therefore put himself in a great
rage about it, and showed the letter to a number
of British officers, particularly to Captain Smith
of the <i>Lark</i> frigate, who instead of joining with
him in disapprobation commended the spirit of
it; upon which General Massey said to him, do
you take the part of a rebel against me? Captain
Smith answered that he rather spoke his sentiments
and there was a dissension in opinion between
them. Some officers took the part of the
general and others of the captain. This I was informed
of by a gentleman who had it from Captain
Smith.</p>

<p>In a few days after this, the prisoners were ordered
to go on board of a man-of-war, which was
bound for New York; but two of them were not
able to go on board, and were left at Halifax; one
died; and the other recovered. This was about
the 12th of October, and soon after we had got on
board, the captain sent for me in particular to
come on the quarter deck. I went, not knowing
that it was Captain Smith or his ship at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and expected to meet the same rigorous usage I
had commonly met with and prepared my mind
accordingly; but when I came on deck, the captain
met me with his hand, welcomed me to his ship,
invited me to dine with him that day, and assured
me that I should be treated as a gentleman, and
that he had given orders that I should be treated
with respect by the ship's crew. This was so unexpected
and sudden a transition that it drew tears
from my eyes which all the ill usage I had before
met with was not able to produce, nor could I at
first hardly speak, but soon recovered myself and
expressed my gratitude for so unexpected a favor;
and let him know that I felt anxiety of mind in
reflecting that his situation and mine was such
that it was not probable that it would ever be in
my power to return the favor. Captain Smith replied
that he had no reward in view, but only
treated me as a gentleman ought to be treated;
he said this is a mutable world, and one gentleman
never knows but it may be in his power to
help another. Soon after I found this to be the
same Captain Smith who took my part against
General Massey; but he never mentioned anything
of it to me, and I thought it impolite in me to interrogate
him as to any disputes which might
have arisen between him and the general on my
account, as I was a prisoner, and that it was at
his option to make free with me on that subject if
he pleased; and if he did not, I might take it for
granted that it would be unpleasing for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
query about it, though I had a strong propensity
to converse with him on that subject.</p>

<p>I dined with the captain agreeable to his invitation,
and oftentimes with the lieutenant, in the
gun-room, but in general ate and drank with my
friend Lovel and the other gentlemen who were
prisoners with me, where I also slept.</p>

<p>We had a little berth inclosed with canvas, between
decks, where we enjoyed ourselves very
well, in hopes of an exchange; besides, our friends
at Halifax had a little notice of our departure and
supplied us with spirituous liquor, and many articles
of provisions for the cost. Captain Burk,
having been taken prisoner, was added to our
company (he had commanded an American armed
vessel) and was generously treated by the captain
and all the officers of the ship, as well as myself.
We now had in all near thirty prisoners on board,
and as we were sailing along the coast, if I recollect
right, off Rhode Island, Captain Burk, with
an under-officer of the ship, whose name I do not
recollect, came to our little berth, proposed to kill
Captain Smith and the principal officers of the
frigate and take it; adding that there were thirty-five
thousand pounds sterling in the same. Captain
Burk likewise averred that a strong party out
of the ship's crew was in the conspiracy, and urged
me, and the gentleman that was with me, to use
our influence with the private prisoners to execute
the design, and take the ship with the cash into
one of our own ports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon which I replied that we had been too
well used on board to murder the officers; that I
could by no means reconcile it to my conscience,
and that, in fact, it should not be done; and while
I was yet speaking my friend Lovel confirmed
what I had said, and farther pointed out the ungratefulness
of such an act; that it did not fall short
of murder, and in fine all the gentlemen in the
berth opposed Captain Burk and his colleague.
But they strenuously urged that the conspiracy
would be found out, and that it would cost them
their lives, provided they did not execute their
design. I then interposed spiritedly and put an
end to further argument on the subject, and told
them that they might depend upon it upon my
honor that I would faithfully guard Captain
Smith's life. If they should attempt the assault I
would assist him, for they desired me to remain
neuter, and that the same honor that guarded
Captain Smith's life would also guard theirs; and
it was agreed by those present not to reveal the
conspiracy, to the intent that no man should be
put to death, in consequence of what had been
projected; and Captain Burk, and his colleague
went to stifle the matter among their associates.
I could not help calling to mind what Captain
Smith said to me, when I first came on board:
"This is a mutable world, and one gentleman
never knows but that it may be in his power to
help another." Captain Smith and his officers still
behaved with their usual courtesy, and I never
heard any more of the conspiracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>We arrived before New York, and cast anchor
the latter part of October, where we remained
several days, and where Captain Smith informed
me that he had recommended me to Admiral
Howe and General Sir William Howe, as a gentleman
of honor and veracity, and desired that I might
be treated as such. Captain Burk was then ordered
on board a prison ship in the harbor. I
took my leave of Captain Smith and, with the other
prisoners, was sent on board a transport ship
which lay in the harbor, commanded by Captain
Craige, who took me into the cabin with him and
his lieutenant. I fared as they did, and was in
every respect well treated, in consequence of directions
from Captain Smith. In a few weeks
after this I had the happiness to part with my
friend Lovel, for his sake, whom the enemy affected
to treat as a private; he was a gentleman
of merit, and liberally educated, but had no commission;
they maligned him on account of his unshaken
attachment to the cause of his country.
He was exchanged for a Governor Philip Skene
of the British. I was continued in this ship till
the latter part of November, where I contracted
an acquaintance with a captain of the British; his
name has slipped my memory. He was what we
may call a genteel, hearty fellow. I remember
an expression of his over a bottle of wine, to this
import: "That there is a greatness of soul for personal
friendship to subsist between you and me,
as we are upon opposite sides, and may at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
day be obliged to face each other in the field." I
am confident that he was as faithful as any officer
in the British army. At another sitting he offered
to bet a dozen of wine that Fort Washington
would be in the hands of the British in three days.
I stood the bet, and would, had I known that that
would have been the case; and the third day afterward
we heard a heavy cannonade, and that day
the fort was taken sure enough. Some months
after, when I was on parole, he called upon me
with his usual humor, and mentioned the bet. I
acknowledged that I had lost it, but he said he
did not mean to take it, then, as I was a prisoner;
that he would another day call upon me, when
their army came to Bennington. I replied that he
was quite too generous, as I had fairly lost it; besides,
the Green Mountain Boys would not suffer
them to come to Bennington. This was all in good
humor. I should have been glad to have seen
him after the defeat at Bennington, but did not.
It was customary for a guard to attend the prisoners,
which was often changed. One was composed
of tories from Connecticut, in the vicinity
of Fairfield and Green Farms. The sergeant's
name was Hoit. They were very full of their invectives
against the country, swaggered of their
loyalty to their king, and exclaimed bitterly
against the "cowardly Yankees," as they were
pleased to term them, but finally contented themselves
with saying that when the country was
overcome they should be well rewarded for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
loyalty out of the estates of the whigs, which
would be confiscated. This I found to be the
general language of the tories, after I arrived
from England on the American coast. I heard
sundry of them relate, that the British generals
had engaged them an ample reward for their
losses, disappointments and expenditures, out of
the forfeited rebels' estates. This language early
taught me what to do with tories' estates, as far as
my influence can go. For it is really a game of
hazard between whig and tory. The whigs must
inevitably have lost all, in consequence of the
abilities of the tories, and their good friends the
British; and it is no more than right the tories
should run the same risk, in consequence of the
abilities of the whigs. But of this more will be
observed in the sequel of this narrative.</p>

<p>Some of the last days of November the prisoners
were landed at New York, and I was admitted to
parole with the other officers, viz.: Proctor, Howland,
and Taylor. The privates were put into
filthy churches in New York, with the distressed
prisoners that were taken at Fort Washington;
and the second night, Sergeant Roger Moore, who
was bold and enterprising, found means to make
his escape with every one of the remaining prisoners
that were taken with him, except three, who
were soon after exchanged. So that out of thirty-one
prisoners, who went with me the round exhibited
in these sheets, two only died with the
enemy, and three only were exchanged; one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
whom died after he came within our lines; all
the rest, at different times, made their escape
from the enemy.</p>

<p>I now found myself on parole, and restricted to
the limits of the city of New York, where I soon
projected means to live in some measure agreeably
to my rank, though I was destitute of cash. My
constitution was almost worn out by such a long
and barbarous captivity. The enemy gave out
that I was crazy, and wholly unmanned, but my
vitals held sound, nor was I delirious any more
than I had been from youth up; but my extreme
circumstances, at certain times, rendered it politic
to act in some measure the madman; and in consequence
of a regular diet and exercise, my blood
recruited, and my nerves in a great measure recovered
their former tone, strength and usefulness,
in the course of six months.</p></div>

<p class="pfs70">RELEASE FROM PRISON.&mdash;WITH WASHINGTON AT VALLEY
FORGE.&mdash;THE HALDIMAND CORRESPONDENCE.</p>


<p>Allen's narrative in the preceding chapter
gives a picture of himself, of the times,
and of the treatment of prisoners by the most
civilized nation on earth. In January, 1777,
with other American officers, he was quartered
on Long Island. In August he was sent to
the provost jail in New York. May 3, 1778,
he was exchanged for Col. Alexander Campbell.
Thus he was treated as a colonel, although
he had no fixed official rank or title
beyond that informally bestowed on him by
Montgomery. He was entertained with gentlemanly
courtesy for two days at General
Campbell's headquarters on Staten Island, and
then crossed New Jersey amid the acclamations
of the people.</p>

<p>For several days he was the guest of Washington
at Valley Forge. Here, eighteen miles
northwest of Philadelphia, where the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
army was revelling in luxury, Washington,
with three thousand men suffering from cold
and hunger, was praying to God for guidance
in so sore a strait. Baron Steuben was there
fresh from the service of Frederic the Great,
disciplining the raw recruits into veteran soldiers
never again to know defeat. There were
Gates, attending a court-martial, and Putnam
and Lafayette. These were among Allen's
red-letter days; courteously entertained by
some of the best soldiers of Europe and America,
and the favored guest of Washington,
could Heaven reward him better for his long
imprisonment? Here he writes a letter to
Congress which Washington forwards inclosed
with his own. Allen began the journey
to his Vermont home in company with Gates,
arriving in Fishkill on May 18, and in Bennington
just four weeks after his release from
prison.</p>

<p>We now come to a chapter in Allen's life
which the biographer must enter upon with a
mind free from prejudice, and with a strong
desire to assimilate the feelings of the age
when our little commonwealth was in process
of formation. About the close of the year
1776, Allen being a prisoner on parole in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
New York, a British officer of rank sent for
him to come to his lodgings. He told him
that his fidelity, although in a wrong cause,
had recommended him to General Sir William
Howe, who wished to make him the colonel of
a regiment of tories. He proposed that Allen
in a few days should go to England, be paid
in gold instead of continental rag money, be
introduced to Lord George Germaine and
probably to the king, return to America with
Burgoyne, assist in reducing the country, and
receive a large tract of land in Vermont or
Connecticut as he preferred. Allen replied:
"If by fidelity I have recommended myself to
General Howe, I shall be loath by unfaithfulness
to lose the general's good opinion; besides,
I view the offer of land to be similar to
that which the devil offered our Saviour, 'to
give him all the kingdoms of the world to fall
down and worship him,' when the poor devil
had not one foot of land on earth."</p>

<p>Mr. B. F. Stevens, an American resident of
London, and an indefatigable collector of documents
relating to early American history
gathered from the British archives, furnishes
a letter written by Alexander C. Wedderburn,
solicitor-general, on the morning of December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
27, 1775, to William Eden, under-secretary
of state. On the same day at noon a cabinet
meeting was to be held at which was to be
considered the disposition to be made of Ethan
Allen and other prisoners who had reached
England five days before. The "Lord S."
referred to is Lord Suffolk, secretary of state,
and the "Attorney" is Lord Edward Therlow,
attorney-general:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Eden</span>:&mdash;I shall certainly attend Lord S.
at 12 o'clock. My idea of the Business does not
differ much from the Attorney's. My thoughts
have been employed upon it ever since I saw you,
and I am persuaded some unlucky incident must
arise if Allen and his People are kept here. It
must be understood that Government does not
mean to execute them, the Prosecution will be remiss
and the Disposition of some People to thwart
it very active. I would therefore send them back,
but I think something more might be done than
merely to return them as Prisoners to America.
Allen, by Kay's [William Kay, secret service agent
at Montreal] account, took up arms because he
was dispossessed of Lands he had settled between
Hampshire and New York, in consequence of an
order of Council settling the boundary of these two
provinces, and had balanced for some time whether
to have recourse to ye Rebels or to Mr. Carleton
[governor-general of the Province of Quebec].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
The doubt of being well received by the latter determined
him to join the former, and Kay adds
that he is a bold, active fellow. I would then
send to him a Person of Confidence with this Proposal:
that his case had been favorably represented
to Government; that the injury he had suffered
was some Alleviation for his crime, and that it
arose from an Abuse of an order of Council which
was never meant to dispossess the Settlers in the
Lands in debate between ye two provinces. If he
has a mind to return to his duty He may not only
have his pardon from Gen. Howe but a Company
of Rangers, and in the event if He behaves well
His lands restored on these terms, he and his men
shall be sent back to Boston at liberty; if he does
not accept them he and they must be disposed of
as the Law directs. If he should behave well it
is an Acquisition. If not there is still an Advantage
in finding a decent reason for not immediately
proceeding against him as a Rebel. Some of the
People who came over in the Ship with him, or
perhaps Kay himself, might easily settle this bargain
if it is set about directly.</p>

<p class="right">Yours ever, <span class="pad4">A. C. W.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A correspondent of the Burlington <cite>Free
Press</cite>, January 7, 1887, adds this comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That it was agreed to in the cabinet appears
in the fact that on the very 27th December, 1775,
Lord George Germaine of the admiralty ordered
that Allen and his associates be returned to General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Howe in Boston. Howe evacuated Boston March
16, 1776, went to Halifax, and thence to New
York. Allen followed him round and was ultimately
a prisoner on parole until the 6th of May,
1778, when he was exchanged for Col. Archibald
Campbell. While he was on parole the "Person
of Confidence" was found to make the proposal
suggested by Wedderburn, and Allen mentions
this in the narrative of his captivity.</p></div>

<p>Who was the British officer of high rank
whom Howe employed to buy up Allen we do
not know, but the American whom Clinton
employed we do know: Beverly Robinson, a
Virginian, made wealthy by marriage with
Susanna Phillipse, sister of Mary Phillipse, for
whom Washington had an attachment. He
was the son of a lieutenant-governor, and an
early associate of Washington. In 1780 occurred
this third attempt to buy Allen. Robinson
was the man selected to make the proposition.
Ethan Allen was the man selected
to be bribed: not Governor Chittenden; not
the soldiers Roger Enos or Seth Warner; not
the diplomat, the treasurer, the financier of the
State, Ira Allen; not the young lawyers Nathaniel
Chipman or S. R. Bradley; but the man
who had been tempted in England and tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in New York, the man whose loyalty had not
been shaken by the endurance of British brutality
for two and one-half years. The
time to hope for success would seem to have
been December, 1775, on English soil, when
he had reasonable grounds to fear being hung
for treason, or in New York, in 1777, when
Washington had been driven out of Long Island,
out of New York City, and chased across
New Jersey. This time chosen was in 1780,
when Congress had alienated Vermont by ignoring
her claims to federation, and had treated
her with such contempt that there was almost
no hope of her joining the United States.</p>

<p>Long Island knew of Ethan's temptation before
he did. The air was full of it. The contents
of Robinson's letter were known to the
tories before Allen received it. The letter
written in February was delivered in July.
Washington heard in July that Allen was in
New York selling himself to the British.
Schuyler had spies everywhere. They reported
Allen in Canada. General James Clinton
suspected Allen. The correspondence and
flag for cartel smelt of treason. Washington
had tried to effect an exchange of prisoners,
and failed. His letter to Haldimand was un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>answered.
Gooch had applied, in July, to
Washington, and Allen wrote to Washington
at the request of the governor. Washington
replied he could not prefer Warner's men to
those who had been prisoners longer, but here
the correspondence languished.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Magazine of American History</cite>, published
in New York, January, 1887, is an article
entitled "A Curious Chapter in Vermont's
History," dated Ottawa, Canada, November,
1886, signed J. L. Payne, in which the writer
says there are hundreds of manuscripts in the
Canadian archives which prove that Vermont
narrowly escaped becoming a British province.
The chief evidence that he furnishes is
extracts from the letters of Capt. Justus Sherwood,
commissioner for General Haldimand,
Governor of Canada. These letters indicate
that on October 26, 1780, Sherwood left Miller
Bay with five privates, a flag, drum, and
fife. On October 28th he is at Herrick's
Camp, a Vermont frontier post of three hundred
men. He is blindfolded and taken to
Colonel Herrick's room. He tells Herrick
that he is sent by Major Carleton to negotiate a
cartel for the exchange of prisoners, and that
he had dispatches from Governor Haldimand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and Major Carleton to Governor Chittenden and
Governor Allen. Next Sherwood is at Allen's
headquarters in Castleton, and Allen having
promised absolute secrecy, Sherwood informs
him that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>General Haldimand was no stranger to their
disputes with the other States respecting jurisdiction,
and that his excellency was perfectly well
informed of all that had lately passed between
congress and Vermont, and of the fixed intentions
of congress never to consent to Vermont's being
a separate State. General Haldimand felt that in
this congress was only duping them, and waited
for a favorable opportunity to crush them; and
therefore it was proper for them to cast off the
congressional yoke and resume their former allegiance
to the king of Great Britain, by doing
which they would secure to themselves those
privileges they had so long contended for with
New York.</p></div>

<p>Allen is reported by Sherwood as replying
that he was attached to the interests of Vermont,
and that nothing but the continued tyranny
of Congress could drive him from allegiance
to the United States; but "Should he
have any proposals to make to General Haldimand
hereafter, they would be nearly as follows:
He will expect to command his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
forces. Vermont must be a government separate
from and independent of any other Province
in America; must chose their own officers
and civil representatives; be entitled to all the
privileges of the other states offered by the
King's commissioners, and the New Hampshire
Grants as chartered by Benning Wentworth,
Governor of New Hampshire, must be
confirmed free from any patents or claims from
New York or other Provinces. He desires me
to inform His Excellency that a revolution of
this nature must be the work of time.... If,
however, Congress should grant Vermont a
seat in that Assembly as a separate State, then
this negotiation to be at an end and be kept
secret on both sides."</p>

<p>On May 7, 1781, Ira Allen visited Canada,
and concerning a conference with him Captain
Sherwood reports to the governor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He says matters are not yet ripe. Governor
Chittenden, General Allen and the major part of
the leading men are anxious to bring about a neutrality,
and are fully convinced that Congress
never intends to confirm them as a separate State;
but they dare not at this time make any separate
agreement with Great Britain until the populace
are better modelled for the purpose.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days later Captain Sherwood reports
to the governor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those suspicious circumstances, with the great
opinion Allen [referring to Col. Ira Allen] seems
to entertain of the mighty power and consequence
of Vermont, induce me to think they flatter themselves
with the belief that, if Britain should invade
them, the neighboring colonies rather than
lose them as a frontier would protect them, and,
on the other hand, should congress invade them,
they could easily be admitted to a union with
Britain at the latest hour, which they would at
the last extremity choose as the least of two evils;
for Allen says they hate congress like the devil,
and have not yet a very good opinion of Britain.
Sometimes I am inclined, from Allen's discourse,
to hope and almost believe that they are endeavoring
to prepare for a reunion. To this I suppose
I am somewhat inclined by my anxious desire that
it may be so.</p></div>

<p>Upon Col. Ira Allen's return to Vermont,
Captain Sherwood reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe Allen has gone with a full determination
to do his utmost for a reunion, and I believe
he will be seconded by Governor Chittenden, his
brother Ethan Allen and a few others, all acting
from interest, without any principle of loyalty.</p></div>

<p class="pfs70">VERMONT'S TREATMENT BY CONGRESS.&mdash;ALLEN'S LETTERS
TO COLONEL WEBSTER AND TO CONGRESS.&mdash;REASONS
FOR BELIEVING ALLEN A PATRIOT.</p>


<p>The conduct of Congress in asking New
York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire to
empower it to settle Vermont, without allowing
her to act as a party but allowing her to
look on, dallying and postponing the measure
indefinitely, indicated New York's control of
Congress, and, as might have been expected,
Vermont's prowess and pluck would not submit
to organic annihilation without a fight.
The British, under advice from home, might
easily strive to take advantage of the bitter
feelings engendered. Congress was struggling
with the question of the ownership of western
lands. Virginia and New York claimed almost
all, the former by virtue of Clarke's conquests
and the latter by purchase of the Iroquois,
both shadowy, attenuated claims. The
smaller States wanted Vermont in the Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to vote against these claims. Ethan Allen's
letters, showing the turmoil of feeling in Vermont,
as well as his own patriotism, have often
been quoted.</p>

<p>To Colonel Webster he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;Last evening I received a flag from Major
Carleton commanding the British forces at Crown
Point, with proposals from General Haldimand,
commander-in-chief in Canada, for settling a cartel
for the exchange of prisoners. Major Carleton
has pledged his faith that no hostilities shall be
committed on any posts or scouts within the limits
of this state during the negotiation. Lest
your state [New York] should suffer an incursion
in the interim of time, I have this day dispatched
a flag to Major Carleton, requesting that he extend
cessation of hostilities on the northern parts
and frontiers of New York. You will therefore
conduct your affairs as to scouts, &amp;c., only on the
defensive until you hear further from me.</p>

<p class="right">I am, &amp;c., <span class="smcap pad4">Ethan Allen</span>.</p>

<p class="negin2 small">To Colonel Webster. To be communicated to Colonel
Williams and the posts on your frontier.</p>
</div>

<p>He also wrote to Colonel Webster:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right padr2"><span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, about break of day</p>
<p class="right">of the 31st October, 1780.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;Maj. Ebenezer Allen who commands at
Pittsford has sent an express to me at this place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
informing me that one of his scouts at 1 or 2
o'clock <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on the 29th instant, from Chimney
Point, discovered four or five ships and gun-boats
and batteaux, the lake covered and black, all
making sail to Ticonderoga, skiffs flying to and
from the vessels to the batteaux giving orders,
and the foregoing quoted from the letter verbatim.
But I cannot imagine that Major Carleton will violate
his truce. I have sent Major Clarke with a
flag to Major Carleton, particularly to confirm the
truce on my part, and likewise to intercede in
behalf of the frontiers of New York. What the
motion of the British may be, or their design, I
know not. You must judge for yourself. I send
out scouts to further discover the object of the
enemy. Maj. [Ebenezer] Allen thinks they have
a design against your state.</p>

<p>From your humble servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethan Allen</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>He wrote to the president of Congress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sunderland</span>, 9 March, 1781.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;Inclosed I transmit your excellency two
letters which I received under the signature
thereto annexed, that they may be laid before congress.
Shall make no comments on them, but
submit the disposal of them to their consideration.
They are the identical and only letters I ever received
from him, and to which I have never returned
any manner of answer, nor have I ever had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the least personal acquaintance with him, directly
or indirectly. The letter of the 2d February,
1781, I received a few days afore with a duplicate
of the other, which I received the latter part of
July last past, in the high road in Arlington,
which I laid before Governor Chittenden and a
number of other principal gentlemen of the state
(within ten minutes after I received it) for advice;
the result, after mature deliberation, and considering
the extreme circumstances of the state, was to
take no further notice of the matter. The reasons
of such a procedure are very obvious to people of
this state, when they consider that congress has
previously claimed an exclusive right of arbitrating
on the existence of Vermont as a separate
government. New York, New Hampshire and
Massachusetts Bay at the same time claiming this
territory, either in whole or in part, and exerting
their influence to make schisms among the citizens,
thereby in a considerable degree weakening this
government and exposing its inhabitants to the
incursions of the British troops and their savage
allies from the province of Quebec. It seems
that those governments, regardless of Vermont's
contiguous situation to Canada, do not consider
that their northern frontiers have been secured by
her, nor of the merit of this state in a long and
hazardous war, but have flattered themselves with
the expectation that this state could not fail (their
help) to be desolated by a foreign enemy, and that
their exorbitant claims and avaricious designs may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
at some future period take place in this district of
country. Notwithstanding those complicated embarrassments,
and I might add discouragements,
Vermont during the last campaign defended her
frontiers, and at the close of it opened a truce
with General Haldimand (who commands the
British troops in Canada) in order to settle a cartel
for the mutual exchange of prisoners, which
continued near four weeks in the same situation,
during which time Vermont secured the northern
frontiers of her own, and that of the state of New
York in consequence of my including the latter in
the truce, although that government could have
but little claim to my protection. I am confident
that congress will not dispute my sincere attachment
to the cause of my country, though I do not
hesitate to say I am fully grounded in opinion
that Vermont has indubitable right to agree on
terms of cessation of hostilities with Great Britain,
provided the United States persist in rejecting
her application for a union with them, for Vermont
of all people would be the most miserable
were she obliged to defend the independence of
United States and they at the same time claiming
full liberty to overturn and ruin the independence
of Vermont. I am persuaded when congress
considers the circumstances of this state, they will
be more surprised that I have transmitted them
the inclosed letters than that I have kept them in
custody so long, for I am as resolutely determined
to defend the independence of Vermont, as con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>gress
are that of the United States, and, rather
than fail, will retire with hardy Green Mountain
Boys into the desolate caverns of the mountains
and wage war with human nature at large.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bennington</span>, May 15, 1781.</p>

<p>A flag which I sent last fall to the British commanding
officer at Crown Point, and which was
there detained near one month, on their return
gave me to understand that they [the British], at
several different times, threatened to captivate your
own person: said that it had been in their power
to take some of your family the last campaign
[during Carleton's invasion in October, 1780, probably],
but that they had an eye to yourself. I
must confess that such conversation before my flag
seems rather flummery than real premeditated
design. However, that there was such conversation
I do not dispute, which you will make such
improvement of as you see fit. I shall conclude
with assuring your honor, that notwithstanding
the late reports, or rather surmises of my corresponding

United States, it is wholly without foundation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The following letter, believed by some people
to have been written by Allen to General
Haldimand, June 16, 1782, though unsigned,
contains what is considered by his traducers
damning evidence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I have to acquaint your excellency that I
had a long conference with ... [a British agent]
last night. He tells me that through the channel
of A [Sherwood] he had to request me in your
name to repair to the shipping on Lake Champlain,
to hold a personal conference with his [your]
excellency. But as the bearer is now going to
get out of my house to repair to his excellency,
and would have set out yesterday had not the intelligence
of the arrival of ... postponed it
until to-day. I thought it expedient to wait your
excellency reconsidering the matter, after discussing
the peculiar situation of both the external
and internal policy of this state with the gentleman
who will deliver this to you, and shall have,
by the time your excellency has been acquainted
with the state of the facts now existing, time to
bring about a further and more extended connection
in favor of the British interest which is now
working at the general assembly at Windsor, near
the Connecticut River. The last refusal of congress
to admit this state into union has done more
to awaken the common people to a sense of that
interest and resentment of their conduct than all
which they had done before. By their own ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>count,
they declare that Vermont does not and
shall not belong to their confederacy. The consequence
is, that they may fight their own battles.
It is liberty which they say they are after, but will
not extend it to Vermont. Therefore Vermont
does not belong either to the confederacy or the
controversy, but are a neutral republic. All the
frontier towns are firm with these gentlemen in
the present administration of government, and,
to speak within bounds, they have a clear majority
of the rank and file in their favor. I am, etc.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;If it should be your excellency's pleasure,
after having conversed with the gentleman who
will deliver these lines, that I should wait on your
excellency at any part of Lake Champlain, I will
do it, except I should find that it would hazard my
life too much. There is a majority in congress,
and a number of the principal officers of the continental
army continually planning against me. I
shall do everything in my power to render this
state a British province.</p></div>

<p>Ira Allen, that shrewd politician, says of the
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This we consider a political proceeding to prevent
the British forces from invading this State.</p></div>

<p>Our reasons for believing Ethan Allen always
a patriot are:</p>

<p>First. His known faithfulness to the American
cause in every case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Second. His hatred of the British and contemptuous
rejection of their proffers of honor
and emoluments when in their power and in
no personal danger if he accepted them.</p>

<p>Third. His natural obstinacy in clinging to
a cause he had espoused.</p>

<p>Fourth. The repeated efforts of the Vermont
government, in which Allen was engaged,
to induce Congress to admit it to the
Union continued during the negotiation.</p>

<p>Fifth. At Allen's request the truce offered
by the British included New York's eastern
frontier, and Vermont promptly responded to
all calls upon her for help.</p>

<p>Sixth. There is reason to believe that General
Washington was informed by General Allen,
in advance of the Haldimand negotiations,
of their purpose.</p>

<p>The state's peculiar frontier, threatened by
Canada, unsupported by the other states, disturbed
by internal dissensions, unable to defend
herself by force, made it necessary to use strategy.
No authority was given the commissioners
by the executive or by the legislature to
treat of anything but an exchange of prisoners.
There is no record that I can find that an effort
was made at any time to induce Vermont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>ers
at large to consider the subject of a British
union. Indeed, Governor Chittenden, in 1793,
giving a list of those in the secret, mentions
only eight, although Ira Allen said, in 1781,
that more were added.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Allen shows in this correspondence
the talent of a diplomat, a talent
which our state needed in its formative period
to supplement the audacity of the hardy Green
Mountain Boys. There could be no question
of disloyalty to the United States, because Vermont
had never belonged to them. He was
intensely loyal to his own state, for whose welfare
he strove, and if Congress still refused to
admit her to the Union, there was no other resource
than to ally her with Great Britain in
self-defence.</p>

IN COURT.</p>


<p>When Allen bade adieu to Washington at
Valley Forge, he rode on horseback to Fishkill
with General Gates and suite, arriving at
that place on the 18th of May, 1778, the very
day his brother Heman died at Salisbury.
The six or eight days occupied by the trip
across New Jersey seems to have been one of
unalloyed enjoyment to the hero of Ticonderoga.
He tells us that Gates treated him with
the generosity of a lord and the freedom of a
boon companion. That this intercourse impressed
Gates favorably with Allen his correspondence
with General Stark later demonstrates.
On Sunday evening, the 31st of May,
Allen arrived at Bennington. The town being
orthodox and Congregationalist, Sunday is
observed with Puritanic severity, but he finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the people too jubilant for religious solemnity.
The old iron six-pound cannon from Fort Hoosac
is brought out and fired in honor of the
new state of Vermont.</p>

<p>What changes have taken place during his
three years' absence! His only son is dead;
his wife and four daughters are in Sunderland;
two brothers have become state officers. Levi
Allen, one of the foremost Green Mountain
Boys in 1775, has now become a tory. Burgoyne
has swept along the western borders
and has been captured. Allen's old followers,
under Seth Warner, have won renown at Quebec,
Montreal, Hubbardston, Bennington, Saratoga,
and Ticonderoga. The constitution has
been formed and the state government organized.
A legislature has been elected, held one
session, and adjourned to meet again this
week.</p>

stump, and cried: "Attention, the whole!"
He then expressed his sympathy with the people,
explained the illegality of the trial, and
told them to go home and return in a week,
and they "shall see a man hung; if not Redding,
I will be," and the appeased crowd peaceably
dispersed. In the next trial Allen was
appointed state's attorney to prosecute Redding,
who was condemned.</p>

<p>Soon Allen's attention is called to the controversy
between New York and Vermont.
In the preceding February, after the constitution
was adopted, before the government
was inaugurated, Governor Clinton, of New
York, issued a proclamation ostentatious with
apparent clemency and generosity. Ethan
Allen was selected as the proper man to expose
the pompous fraud. Clinton began by
saying that the disaffection existing in Vermont
was partially justified by the atrocious
acts of the British government while New
York was a colony, the act of outlawry which
sentenced Allen and others to death without
trial, the fees and unjust preference in grants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to servants of the crown over honest settlers,
and he offered to discharge all claims under
the outlawry act, to reduce the New York
quit-rents to the New Hampshire rate, to make
the fees of patents reasonable, and to confirm
all grants made by New Hampshire and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Allen replied, in a pamphlet, that the British
act of outlawry had been dead by its own provision
two and a half years, no thanks to Clinton;
that most of the grants of New Hampshire
and Massachusetts had been covered by New
York patents, and that, as a matter of law, it
was impossible for New York to cancel her
former patents and confirm the New Hampshire
grants, and he cited the opinion of the
lords of trade to that effect.</p>

<p>But Vermont was in a dangerous position in
reference to New Hampshire. A portion of
that state had seceded and united with Vermont.
The two states had fought side by
side, but now New Hampshire had become
unfriendly and remained so for years. The
governor and council, perplexed with the difficulty,
appointed Allen an agent to visit Congress
and ask for advice. This is his first
embassy from Vermont to Congress. He re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>ported
that "unless the union with New
Hampshire towns is dissolved the nation will
annihilate Vermont."</p>

<p>His second embassy was with Jonas Fay, in
1779, to inform Congress of the progress of
affairs in Vermont.</p>

<p>His third embassy was in 1780, when he was
chosen by the legislature as the chairman of
a very able and eminent committee, Stephen
R. Bradley, Moses Robinson, Paul Spooner,
and Jonas Fay, to act as counsel for Vermont
before Congress against the ablest men of New
York and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>In 1779 he was sent to the Massachusetts
court with a letter from the governor asking
for a statement of Massachusetts' claim to
Vermont. The reply was that Massachusetts
claimed west from the Merrimac, and three
miles further north, to the Pacific. This included
part of Vermont.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Allen was elected a
member of the legislature from Arlington
while his family lived in Sunderland, and he
called Bennington his "usual home." It is
notable, also, that the constitution required
every member of the legislature to take an
oath that he believed in the divine inspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of the Bible and professed the Protestant religion,
an oath which Allen refused to take,
and yet was allowed to act as a member.</p>

<p>It was in 1778 that Allen complained to the
court of confiscation that his brother Levi had
become a tory; had passed counterfeit Continental
money; that under pretence of helping
him while a prisoner on Long Island, he had
been detected in supplying the British with
provisions. He stated that Levi owned real
estate in Vermont and prayed that that estate
might be confiscated to the public treasury.
For this act Levi afterward challenged Ethan
to a duel, but Ethan took no notice of the challenge.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1779 the Yorkers in Windham
County wrote to Governor Clinton that
unless New York aided them, "our persons
and property must be at the disposal of Ethan
Allen; which is more to be dreaded than death
with all its terrors."</p>

<p>In May the superior court sat at Westminster.
Thirty-six Yorkers were in jail. Their
offence consisted in rescuing two cows from
an officer who had seized them because their
owners had refused to do military duty on the
frontier or to pay for substitutes. Ethan Al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>len
was there by order of Governor Chittenden,
with one hundred Green Mountain Boys,
to aid the court. Three prisoners were discharged
for want of evidence, three more because
they were minors. Allen, hearing of
this, entered the court-room in his military
dress, large three-cornered hat profusely ornamented
with gold lace, and a large sword
swinging by his side. Breathless with haste,
he bowed to Chief Justice Robinson and began
attacking the attorneys. Robinson told
him the court would gladly listen to him as a
citizen, but not as a military man in a military
dress. Allen threw his hat on the table and
unbuckled his sword, exclaiming: "For forms
of government let fools contest; whate'er is
best administered is best." Observing the
judges whispering together, he said: "I said
that fools might contest, not your honors, not
your honors." To the state's attorney, Noah
Smith, he said: "I would have the young gentleman
know that with my logic and reasoning
from the eternal fitness of things, I can upset
his Blackstones, his whitestones, his gravestones,
and his brimstones." Then he continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fifty miles I have come through the woods with
my brave men to support the civil with the military
arm, to quell any disturbances should they
arise, and to aid the sheriff and court in prosecuting
these Yorkers, the enemies of our noble State.
I see, however, that some of them, by the quirks
of this artful lawyer, Bradley, are escaping from
the punishment they so richly deserve, and I find
also, that this little Noah Smith is far from understanding
his business, since he at one moment
moves for a prosecution and in the next wishes to
withdraw it. Let me warn your honors to be on
your guard lest these delinquents should slip
through your fingers and thus escape the rewards
so justly due their crimes.</p></div>

<p>Allen then put on his hat, buckled on his
sword, and departed with great dignity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="pfs70">ALLEN AT GUILFORD.&mdash;"ORACLES OF REASON."&mdash;JOHN
STARK.&mdash;ST. JOHN DE CRÈVECŒUR.&mdash;HONORS TO
ALLEN.&mdash;SHAY'S REBELLION.&mdash;SECOND MARRIAGE.</p>


<p>In 1782 the rebellious York element in
Windham County again called Ethan to the
field. In Guilford forty-six men ambushed
and fired on Allen's party in the evening.
Allen, knowing the terror of his name, entering
Guilford on foot, uttered this proclamation:
"I, Ethan Allen, do declare that I will
give no quarter to the man, woman, or child
who shall oppose me, and unless the inhabitants
of Guilford peacefully submit to the authority
of Vermont, I swear that I will lay it
as desolate as Sodom and Gomorrah by God."</p>

<p>In 1784 Allen published a book entitled
"Reason, the Only Oracle of Man: or, A Compendious
System of Natural Religion." In
this book Allen endeavored to prove that the
Bible was not inspired, but he declared it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
necessity that a future life of rewards and punishments
follow the good and evil of this life.
His idea of the Deity is expressed in these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The knowledge of the being, perfections, creation
and providence of God and the immortality
of our souls is the foundation of our religion.</p></div>

<p>This book contained 487 pages. Fifteen
hundred copies were issued, but most of them
were destroyed by the burning of the printing
office. Allen wrote to a friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this book you read my very soul, for I have
not concealed my opinion. I expect that the
clergy and their devotees will proclaim war with
me in the name of the Lord.</p></div>

<p>Sometimes Allen is too profane to be repeated,
sometimes too frivolous for sacred subjects.
Speaking of his prospects of being hung
in England, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As to the world of spirits, though I know nothing
of the mode or manner of it, I expected nevertheless,
when I should arrive at such a world,
that I should be as well treated as other gentlemen
of my merit.</p></div>

<p>Among the pleasant friends that Allen
formed at this time was John Stark. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hero of Ticonderoga had never met the hero
of Bennington. Three weeks after Allen's
arrival in Bennington, Stark wrote to him proposing
an interview at Albany, where he was
stationed as brigadier-general in command of
the northern department. He also wrote to
General Gates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I should be very glad to have Colonel Ethan
Allen command in the grants, as he is a very
suitable man to deal with tories and such like
villains.</p></div>

<p>Four days later Gates wrote Stark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I now inclose two letters, one to Colonel Ethan
Allen and one to Colonel Bedel ... it may not
be amiss to take Colonel Allen's opinion on the
subject, with whom I wish you to open a correspondence.</p></div>

<p>Another pleasant episode in Allen's life was
his association with St. John de Crèvecœur,
who was the French consul in New York for
ten years following the revolution. Sieur
Crèvecœur married an American Quakeress,
bought a farm which he cleared, wrote a book
in English called "Letters from an American
Farmer," and three volumes in French about
upper Pennsylvania and New York. He wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to Ethan Allen proposing to have the Vermont
state seal engraved in silver by the king's
best engravers, asked for maps of the state,
suggested naming some towns after French
statesmen who had befriended America. (St.
Johnsbury was named for Crèvecœur.) He
asked Allen for copies of his "Oracles of Reason"
and also for some seeds.</p>

<p>Instances multiply showing the prominence
of Ethan Allen in the new state. During
Shay's rebellion in Massachusetts, before attempting
to seize the United States arsenal at
Springfield, he sent two of his principal officers
to Ethan Allen offering to him the command
of the Massachusetts insurgents, representing
one-third of the population of that
state. Allen rejected the offer with contempt
and ordered the messengers to leave the state.
He also wrote to the governor of Massachusetts
and Colonel Benjamin Simmons, of western
Massachusetts, informing them of the efforts
made in Vermont by malcontents from
that state, and that Vermont was exerting herself
vigorously to prevent the evil consequences
of the insurgents' action, and promising the
most cordial co-operation in the future.</p>

<p>The incidents of Allen's life and his writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>ings
are not published in any one volume, but
are scattered through ill-bound primers, are
found in fiction, in addresses, and in huge
double-column tomes which are not accessible
to the people.</p>

<p>The story of his second marriage gives a
vivid picture of the rough-and-ready audacious
soldier. On the 9th of February, 1784, the
judges of the supreme court were at breakfast
with lawyer Stephen R. Bradley, of Westminster,
when General Allen, in a sleigh with
a span of dashing black horses and a colored
driver, drove up to the house. Passing through
the breakfast-room, he found in the next room
the spirited young widow of twenty-four summers,
Mrs. Frances Buchanan, who was living
in the house with her mother, Mrs. Wall.
Dressed in her morning gown, Mrs. Buchanan
was standing on a chair arranging china and
glass on some upper shelves. She amused her
visitor with some witticism about the broken
decanter in her hands; a brief chat ensued,
then Allen said: "Fanny, if we are ever to be
married, now is the time, for I am on my way
to Arlington."</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied; "give me time to
put on my josie."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The couple passed into a third room, where
the judges were smoking, and Allen said:</p>

<p>"Judge Robinson, this young woman and
myself have concluded to marry each other,
and to have you perform the ceremony."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Now! For myself I have no great opinion
of such formality, and from what I can discover
she thinks as little of it as I do. But as
a decent respect for the opinion of mankind
seems to require it, you will proceed."</p>

<p>"General, this is an important matter, and
have you given it serious consideration?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but," here the general glanced
proudly at his handsome and accomplished
bride, twenty-two years younger than himself,
perhaps also conscious of his own mature, stalwart
symmetry, "I do not think it requires
much consideration in this particular case."</p>

<p>"Do you promise to live with Frances agreeably
to the law of God?"</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" cried Allen, looking out of
the window. "Yes, according to the law of
God as written in the great book of Nature.
Go on! go on! my team is at the door."</p>

<p>Soon the bride's guitar and trunk were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the sleigh and the bells jingled merrily as they
dashed westward.</p>

<p>Before his second marriage John Norton, a
tavern-keeper of Westminster, said:</p>

<p>"Fanny, if you marry General Allen you will
be the queen of a new state."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "and if I should marry
the devil I would be queen of hell."</p>

<p>The children of the second marriage were
three: one daughter who died in a nunnery
in Montreal, and two sons who became officers
in the United States Army and died at Norfolk,
Va. Ethan Allen, of New York, is a
grandson of the second wife.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="pfs70">DEATH.&mdash;CIVILIZATION IN ALLEN'S TIME.&mdash;ESTIMATES
OF ALLEN.&mdash;RELIGIOUS FEELING IN VERMONT.&mdash;MONUMENTS.</p>


<p>In 1787 Allen moved to Burlington, where,
for the last two years of his life, he devoted
himself to farming. Through a partial failure
of the crops in 1789, Allen found himself short
of hay in the winter. Col. Ebenezer Allen,
who lived in South Hero, an island near Burlington,
offered to supply Ethan what he
needed if he would come for it. Accordingly,
with a team and man, Ethan crossed the ice
on the 10th of February. Col. Ebenezer Allen
had invited some neighbors, who were old
friends and acquaintances, to meet his guest,
and the afternoon and evening were spent in
telling stories. Ethan was persuaded to stay
over night and the next morning started for
home with his load of hay. During the journey
his negro spoke to him several times but
received no reply. On reaching home he dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>covered
that his master was unconscious. He
was carried into his house and died from apoplexy
in a few hours.</p>

<p>To estimate properly Allen's force of character
and large mind, we should appreciate
the crude civilization of the early pioneer days
of Vermont, when self-culture could only be
procured by great qualities. The population
was about five thousand, chiefly on the east
side of the mountains. The bulk of the people
lived in log houses with earthen floors,
and with windows made of oiled paper, isinglass,
raw hides, or sometimes 6 x 8 panes of
glass. Smaller log houses were used to protect
domestic animals from wolves and bears,
as well as from the inclemency of the weather.
It was the life of the frontier in the wilderness,
when the struggle for bare sustenance
left little time for the acquirement of knowledge,
much less of accomplishments.</p>

<p>Allen is not the best representative man of
his time, but his experience was so startling,
his character so piquant, that a sketch of him
better photographs Vermont before her admission
to the Union than that of any other
man. As a statesman he was infinitely inferior
to Chipman or Bradley; as a soldier, Seth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Warner, although six years younger, was his
superior; Ira Allen was more capable and
more accomplished; Governor Chittenden was
more discreet in the management of state affairs.
As a captive, absent from the state
from 1775 to 1778, Allen had nothing to do
with the adoption of the constitution or the
first organization of our state government; as
a member of the legislature he won no reputation.
He lacked the scholarly culture and polished
suavity of the highest type of gentleman;
he was sometimes horribly profane. He delighted
in battling with the religious orthodoxy
of New England; he wrote a book to disprove
the authenticity of the Bible; yet he was energetic
in his expressions of veneration for the
being and perfection of the Deity, and a firm
believer in the immortality of the soul.
Thoroughly familiar with the history and law
of the New York controversy, his telling exposure
of the subtle casuistry of the more
learned New York lawyers; his thorough sympathy
with the settlers in all their trials and
amusements; his geniality, sociability, and
aptness in story-telling; his detestation of all
dishonesty and meanness; his burning zeal for
American freedom; his adroit success, his bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>ter
sufferings, even his one unlucky rashness
in attacking Montreal when deserted by the
very man who had induced him to undertake it;
his numerous writings&mdash;all combine to make
him the most popular of our state characters.</p>

<p>Washington's masterly knowledge of human
nature gives value to his brief portrait of Allen.
Immediately on being released from captivity,
Allen visited Washington at Valley Forge.
Washington wrote to Congress in regard to
Allen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His fortitude and firmness seem to have placed
him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an
original something about him that commands admiration,
and his long captivity and sufferings
have only served to increase, if possible, his enthusiastic
zeal. He appears very desirous of
rendering his services to the states and of being
employed, and at the same time he does not discover
any ambition for high rank.</p></div>

<p>Senator Edmunds says of Allen: "Ethan Allen
was a man of gifts rather than acquirements,
although he was not by any means deficient
in that knowledge obtained from reading
and from intercourse with men. But it
was the natural force of his character that
made him eminent among the worthiest who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
founded the republic, and pre-eminent among
those who founded the state of Vermont."</p>

<p>Col. John A. Graham, who knew Allen well
the last two or three years of his life, published
a book in England a few years after Allen's
death and therein says: "Ethan Allen was a
man of extraordinary character. He possessed
great talents but was deficient in education.
In all his dealings he possessed the strictest
sense of honor, integrity, and uprightness."</p>

<p>The Hon. Daniel P. Thompson attributes to
him "wisdom, aptitude to command, ability
to inspire respect and confidence, a high sense
of honor, generosity, and kindness."</p>

<p>Jared Sparks calls him "brave, generous,
consistent, true to his friends, true to his country,
seeking at all times to promote the best
interests of mankind."</p>

<p>Governor Hiland Hall says: "He acquired
much information by reading and observation.
His knowledge of the political situation of the
state and country was general and accurate.
As a writer, he was ready, clear, and forcible.
His style attracted and fixed attention and inspired
confidence in his sincerity and justice."</p>

<p>John Jay speaks of his writings as having
"wit, quaintness, and impudence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>In financial skill Ethan was inferior to his
brother Ira; as a soldier he lacked the cool
judgment of Seth Warner; in administrative
ability he had neither the tact nor success of
Governor Chittenden; as a statesman he was
destitute of the learning and ability of Chipman
and Bradley; but as a patriot and friend
he was true as a star. No money, no office,
could bribe; no insults, no suffering, tame him.
As a boon companion he was rollicking and
popular. Many are the stories told of his
hearty good-will toward all. One instance will
show his power to attach the common people
to him: Finding a woman in Tinmouth dreading
to have a painful tooth drawn, in order to
encourage her he sat down and had one of his
perfectly sound teeth extracted.</p>

<p>In religion, like Horace Greeley, Allen had
reverence for the Deity but none for the
Bible. In this he was not alone, for Vermont,
in the later eighteenth century, presented a
curious mixture of the strictest adherence to
the letter of the religious law and absolute
free-thinking.</p>

<p>The Universalists in 1785 held their first
American convention in Massachusetts. When
this doctrine was first introduced into Ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>mont,
John Norton, the Westminster tavern-keeper,
said to Ethan Allen: "That religion
will suit you, will it not, General Allen?"</p>

<p>Allen, who knew Norton to be a secret tory,
replied in utter scorn: "No! no! for there
must be a hell in the other world for the punishment
of tories."</p>

<p>President Dwight said: "Many of the influential
early Vermonters were professed infidels
or Universalists, or persons of equally
loose principles and morals." Judge Robert
R. Livingston wrote Dr. Franklin: "The bulk
of Vermonters are New England Presbyterian
whigs." Daniel Chipman says: "Great numbers
of the early settlers were of the set of
New-lights or Separates, who fled from persecution
in the New England States and found
religious liberty here."</p>

<p>Before Allen took Ticonderoga, Vermont
had eleven Congregational and four Baptist
churches. For a quarter of a century (1783-1807)
towns and parishes could assess taxes for
churches and ministers. At the very threshold
of Vermont's existence the laws had a Puritanic
severity. "High-handed blasphemy"
was punished with death; while fines or the
stocks were the rewards of profane swearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
drunkenness, unseasonable night-walking, disturbing
Sabbath worship, travelling Sunday,
gaming, horse-racing, confirmed tavern-haunting,
mischievous lying, and even meeting in
company Saturday or Sunday evenings except
in religious meetings. "No person shall drive
a team or droves of any kind, or travel on the
Lord's day (except it be on business that concerns
the present war, or by some adversity
they are belated and forced to lodge in the
woods, wilderness, or highways the night before),"
then only to next shelter. The wife of
the Rev. Sam. Williams was arrested in New
Hampshire for travelling on Sunday. No
Jew, Roman Catholic, atheist, or deist could
take the oath required of a member of the
legislature; for that oath professed belief in
the Deity, the divine inspiration of both Testaments,
and the Protestant religion. The Rev.
Samuel Peters, LL.D., sometimes called Bishop
Peters, tells us the Munchausen story that
he baptized into the Church of England 1,200
adults and children amid the forests of Vermont.
In 1790 Vermont was enough of a diocese
to hold a convention of eight parishes and
two rectors.</p>

<p>Bennington was the early nucleus of Ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>mont
colonization. Samuel Robinson, of that
town, had land to sell both in Bennington and
the adjoining town of Shaftsbury. It is said
he entertained over night the new immigrants;
if Baptists, he sold them land in Shaftsbury;
if Congregationalists, he sold them land in
Bennington.</p>

<p>What visible tokens have we of Vermont's
pride in this hero, to whom she is so much indebted
for her existence as a state?</p>

<p>The earliest statue of Ethan Allen was by
Benjamin Harris Kinney, a native of Sunderland.
It was modelled in Burlington and exhibited
there in 1852. The Rev. Zadoc Thompson
said of it: "All who have long and carefully
examined his statue will admit that the
artist, Mr. Kinney, our respected townsman,
has embodied and presented to the eye the
ideal in a most masterly manner." The Hon.
David Read says: "The statue was examined
by several aged people who had personally
known Allen, and all pronounce it an excellent
likeness of him." Henry de Puy has
an engraving of this statue in his book about
Allen in 1853. This statue has never been
purchased from Mr. Kinney, and it is still in
his possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The two statues of Allen made for the state
are the work of Larkin G. Mead, a native of
Chesterfield, N. H., reared and educated in
Brattleboro. One of them, at the entrance of
the state-house in Montpelier, is of Rutland
marble. The other one, in the Capitol at
Washington, is of Italian marble.</p>

<p>The fourth statue was unveiled at Burlington,
the 4th of July, 1873. It was made at
Carrara, Italy, after a design by Peter Stephenson,
of Boston. It is 8 ft. 4 in. high, stands
on a granite shaft 42 ft. in height, in Green
Mountain Cemetery, on the banks of the Winooski.</p>

<p class="negin2 lht"><b>HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES</b>, from the Discovery
of the Continent to the Establishment of the Constitution in 1789.
By <span class="smcap">George Bancroft</span>. Complete in 6 vols., 8vo, printed from new
type. Cloth (blue or brown), uncut, with gilt top, $15.00; sheep,
marble edge, $21.00; half morocco, uncut, gilt top, $27.00; half
grained morocco, gilt top, $27.00; half calf, marble edge, $27.00.
Vol. VI contains the History of the Formation of the Constitution
of the United States, and a Portrait of Mr. Bancroft.</p>


<p>In this edition of his great work the author has made extensive
changes in the text, condensing in places, enlarging in others, and carefully
revising. It is practically a new work embodying the results of
the latest researches, and enjoying the advantage of the author's long
and mature experience.</p>

<p class="lhtx">"On comparing this work with the corresponding volume of the 'Centenary'
edition of 1876, one is surprised to see how extensive changes the author
has found desirable, even after so short an interval. The first thing that strikes
one is the increased number of chapters, resulting from subdivision. The first
volume contains two volumes of the original, and is divided into thirty-eight
chapters instead of eighteen. This is in itself an improvement. But the new
arrangement is not the result merely of subdivision; the matter is rearranged in
such a manner as vastly to increase the lucidity and continuousness of treatment.
In the present edition Mr. Bancroft returns to the principle of division
into periods, abandoned in the 'Centenary' edition. His division is, however,
a new one. As the permanent shape taken by a great historical work, this new
arrangement is certainly an improvement."&mdash;<cite>The Nation</cite> (<em>New York</em>).</p>

<p class="lhtx">"The work as a whole is in better shape, and is of course more authoritative
than ever before. This last revision will be without doubt, both from its desirable
form and accurate text, the standard one."&mdash;<cite>Boston Traveller.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"It has not been granted to many historians to devote half a century to the
history of a single people, and to live long enough, and, let us add, to be willing
and wise enough, to revise and rewrite in an honored old age the work of a
whole lifetime."&mdash;<cite>New York Mail and Express.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"The extent and thoroughness of this revision would hardly be guessed without
comparing the editions side by side. The condensation of the text amounts
to something over one third of the previous edition. There has also been very
considerable recasting of the text. On the whole, our examination of the first
volume leads us to believe that the thought of the historian loses nothing by the
abbreviation of the text. A closer and later approximation to the best results of
scholarship and criticism is reached. The public gains by its more compact
brevity and in amount of matter, and in economy of time and money."&mdash;<cite>The Independent</cite>
(<em>New York</em>).</p>

<p class="lhtx">"There is nothing to be said at this day of the value of 'Bancroft.' Its authority
is no longer in dispute, and as a piece of vivid and realistic historical
writing it stands among the best works of its class. It may be taken for granted
that this new edition will greatly extend its usefulness."&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia North
American.</cite></p>

<p class="noindent lhtx">"The Rear-Guard of the Revolution" is a narrative of the adventures of the
pioneers that first crossed the Alleghanies and settled in what is now Tennessee, under
the leadership of two remarkable men, James Robertson and John Sevier. The title
of the book is derived from the fact that a body of hardy volunteers, under the leadership
of Sevier, crossed the mountains, and by their timely arrival secured the defeat
of the British army at King's Mountain.</p>

<p class="noindent lhtx">John Sevier was among the pioneers who settled the region in Eastern Tennessee.
He was the founder of the State of Franklin, which afterward became Tennessee, and

<p class="noindent lhtx">This work is in a measure a continuation of the thrilling story told by the author in
his two preceding volumes, "The Rear-Guard of the Revolution" and "John Sevier
as a Commonwealth-Builder." The three volumes together cover, says the author
in his preface, "a neglected period of American history, and they disclose facts well
worthy the attention of historians&mdash;namely, that these Western men turned the tide
of the American Revolution, and subsequently saved the newly-formed Union from

in five volumes. Vols. I, II,
and III now ready. 8vo, cloth, gilt
top, $2.50 each.</p>

<p class="lhtx">In the course of this narrative much is written
of wars, conspiracies, and rebellions; of Presidents,
of Congresses, of embassies, of treaties,
of the ambition of political leaders, and of the
rise of great parties in the nation. Yet the history
of the people is the chief theme. At every
stage of the splendid progress which separates the
America of Washington and Adams from the
America in which we live, it has been the author's
purpose to describe the dress, the occupations,
the amusements, the literary canons of the times; to note the changes
of manners and morals; to trace the growth of that humane spirit which
abolished punishment for debt, and reformed the discipline of prisons and
of jails; to recount the manifold improvements which, in a thousand ways,
have multiplied the conveniences of life and ministered to the happiness of
our race; to describe the rise and progress of that long series of mechanical
inventions and discoveries which is now the admiration of the world, and our
just pride and boast; to tell how, under the benign influence of liberty and
peace, there sprang up, in the course of a single century, a prosperity unparalleled
in the annals of human affairs.</p>

<p class="lhtx">"The pledge given by Mr. McMaster, that 'the history of the people shall be the
chief theme,' is punctiliously and satisfactorily fulfilled. He carries out his promise in
a complete, vivid, and delightful way. We should add that the literary execution of
the work is worthy of the indefatigable industry and unceasing vigilance with which
the stores of historical material have been accumulated, weighed, and sifted. The
cardinal qualities of style, lucidity, animation, and energy, are everywhere present.
Seldom indeed has a book in which matter of substantial value has been so happily
united to attractiveness of form been offered by an American author to his fellow-citizens."&mdash;<cite>New
York Sun.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"To recount the marvelous progress of the American people, to describe their life,
their literature, their occupations, their amusements, is Mr. McMaster's object. His
theme is an important one, and we congratulate him on his success. It has rarely been
our province to notice a book with so many excellences and so few defects."&mdash;<cite>New York
Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"Mr. McMaster at once shows his grasp of the various themes and his special
capacity as a historian of the people. His aim is high, but he hits the mark."&mdash;<cite>New
York Journal of Commerce.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"... The author's pages abound, too, with illustrations of the best kind of historical
work, that of unearthing hidden sources of information and employing them, not
after the modern style of historical writing, in a mere report, but with the true artistic
method, in a well-digested narrative.... If Mr. McMaster finishes his work in the
spirit and with the thoroughness and skill with which it has begun, it will take its place
among the classics of American literature."&mdash;<cite>Christian Union.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">The present work is meant, in the first instance, for the young&mdash;not alone
for boys and girls, but for young men and women who have yet to make
themselves familiar with the more important features of their country's
history. By a book for the young is meant one in which the author studies to
make his statements clear and explicit, in which curious and picturesque details
are inserted, and in which the writer does not neglect such anecdotes as
lend the charm of a human and personal interest to the broader facts of the
nation's story. That history is often tiresome to the young is not so much
the fault of history as of a false method of writing by which one contrives
to relate events without sympathy or imagination, without narrative connection
or animation. The attempt to master vague and general records of
kiln-dried facts is certain to beget in the ordinary reader a repulsion from
the study of history&mdash;one of the very most important of all studies for its
widening influence on general culture.</p>

<p class="lhtx">"The book in its new dress makes a much

as gladly as its predecessor

as the text engages the mind."&mdash;<cite>New York Critic.</cite></p>

<p class="lhtx">"The author writes history as a story. It can never be

I also am an American!' We have many books of biography, but I have seen none

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
